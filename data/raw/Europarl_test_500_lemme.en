we are backing you , Mr Orbán , and we are cheering you on , because that mean cheering Hungary on and cheering Europe on a a whole .
the people who are asking u to close off access to the Internet are importing into Europe music produced elsewhere .
in addition to that , the contribution of aviation to our failure to achieve the Kyoto target is still massive .
the first aspect is the importance of the legislative process within the European Union .
contrary to Mr Evans & apos ; s report , which , despite certain positive aspect , is still too timid in it approach , I believe the right of asylum should be absolute and unquestionable .
that , I believe , is extremely important if we are to be able to move ahead a a successful society .
an institution which leaf such an impression on people is no longer up to date ; change is required .
first of all I would say in reply to Mr Sjöstedt & apos ; s question that the European Council in Madrid fixed the starting date for the third stage at 1 January 1999 .
if the Member States provide evidence that certain element within the seven directive are still necessary , for example , on consumer protection ground , such a provision from the directive relating to tyre pressure gauge for motor vehicle , these section will be incorporated into the Framework measuring instrument Directive .
overall , the total of EUR 870 billion at which we have arrived , that is around 1.06 % of the European Union ’ s gross national income , is close to the figure that have been discussed .
with these qualification , a we certainly do not want to adopt the American situation here overnight , more mobility for employee and young people is a goal of ours .
it is certainly true that the presence of DHA in breast milk ha a positive impact on the visual development of infant up to 12 month .
do not place the EFSA in any building or venue that ha close connection with the institution of the European Union .
the location of the Foreign Service is therefore a crucial issue .
without making a parallel between the Soviet Union and present-day Russia , I want to say that what I heard from Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mrs Malmström is gratifying because it continues this policy of pragmatic partnership with Russia , highlighting that there are issue where the European Union can not achieve success without the involvement of Russia .
it is , of course , too early to comment on this recent round of talk , but we hope that both side will proceed in a constructive manner .
this will have the effect of undermining the principle of equality , universality and social cohesion and , most importantly , the possibility of upholding fundamental human right in practice .
this is not what we are debating .
import ban , though , should be a last line of defence .
I also think it is important to establish that each Member State ha a perfect right to examine each asylum application itself .
in the programme we emphasised that patient safety is an important area .
Iran , for it part , must suspend any activity designed to obtain nuclear material for military purpose ; it must do so because it ha signed the non-proliferation Treaty , thus also undertaking to apply it Additional Protocol .
we want the European Union to intervene more actively in this area and to step up it involvement in assisting these country in their reform process .
the fact is , however , that until the institutional issue is resolved , this doubt is always present and , particularly when we are outside Europe , we are confronted with question to which we have to attach due prominence .
it is important to insist that the Commission draw up a proposal for a common list of additive by the end of 2004 at the latest .
the exchange of view that we have had here or in committee have given u food for thought a to which strategy should be applied .
in my view , many of the amendment tabled by Members reflect important issue that are not reflected adequately in the Commission proposal .
these are worker who must be safeguarded and protected .
doe it mean the USA-style development , where new job actually mean job which pay salary that no one can live on , or doe it mean dialogue in the labour market ?
it now seems to be an established practice always to have a special session on human right and democracy before Christmas .
they asked who should be a player in this regard and whether it wa a matter for Europe in the first place and felt that perhaps we should not get too carried in making decision , and so forth .
he said that the Swedish Government is offending against the internal market and that he intended to take action against the Swedish Government when the case wa dealt with by the Court .
nevertheless , we voted in favour of the report a a whole because rejecting it would have led to a great deal of confusion , since we would have been leaving in place a system in which Members & apos ; travel expense are not being claimed on the basis of the genuine cost incurred , which in our opinion they should be .
let me close with a few figure on the volume of next year ’ s general budget .
in conclusion , bearing in mind the incentive we have regarding some of our neighbour such a Ukraine , it is clear that , while we now have the great task of completing this enlargement , we must also open the debate on Europe & apos ; s border , on it root , on all these issue .
congratulation to everybody today , but I would point out that there will be great resistance if there is any intention to take with one hand tomorrow what is given today with the other .
if the Union in it wisdom would appoint Mr Jarzembowski to be the inspector of TENs superstructure in all the port of the European Union , that would mean he wa gainfully employed , dedicated to the service of the Community .
on average only just under a third of household waste in Europe is recycled or composted .
I got involved in drafting this European Parliament resolution on failure in protection of human right and justice in the Democratic Republic of Congo based on a desire to find a way of making those responsible for these action respect civil right and freedom , a well a human dignity and the international commitment to which the country is party .
it also ha to be said that the way in which the European Union ha gone about thing there is hardly likely to call forth rapturous enthusiasm about the success of the work it doe .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the excellent own-initiative report by my Austrian colleague Richard Seeber in response to the communication by the European Commission entitled & apos ; addressing the challenge of water scarcity and drought in the European Union & apos ; .
but can we , in such a situation , talk of the legitimacy of the elected government ?
the euro is now a reality that is becoming more and more concrete every day , but that doe not mean we can regard it without particular apprehension and attention .
the Bureau ha proposed a figure of 20.46 % - in other word , EUR 39 million above the figure for 2010 .
why ha the United Nations Security Council failed to reinforce this demand with a mandatory resolution under Chapter VII ?
to coordinate the aid from country more effectively , to ensure our aid is more efficient , to speak with a European voice that is identifiable in the world and to live up to the world & apos ; s expectation of u at such time : to support this humanitarian crisis and promote development .
this directive is worthy of our approval .
we suggested that , considering the original proposal , we could envisage launching the programme even with EUR 100 million rather than EUR 150 million .
I greet such sign of determination with pleasure .
cohesion policy , the Structural Funds and regional policy are , and will , remain a crucial element of the European project .
in 1991 we had to borrow IEP760 million to keep public service going .
instead of protecting the life and right of citizen , the president , the prime minister , the prosecurot & apos ; s office , the Ministry of Interior and the Sofia mayor have merged into a symbiotic entity and are using the lever of power solely for political recketeering of those who disagree with them .
the Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee - I can not quite believe we had to fight for that , but still - and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain task .
since that day there ha been no talk about making European agriculture competitive , but I want to thank Mr Fischler for continuing with that theme and at least putting forward the aspiration that European agriculture can take it place in the world and take it share of world market .
I hope we will be able to improve dialogue and cooperation between all those concerned in order to secure a sustainable future for our industry .
a the rapporteur maintains , this proposal for a regulation is a step towards more comprehensive environmental accounting .
at the moment , it is important that each state adopts this measure , a otherwise there is the risk of causing panic among the population .
I support enlargement and strengthening , and I am against agreeing to give up on strengthening .
woman & apos ; s right are human right .
. ( PT ) I wish to congratulate Mrs Sudre on her report , which concern extending exemption arrangement for dock due , authorising partial or total exemption from this tax for local production in the French overseas department .
given that Community legislation doe not apply in third country , it is currently not possible to ensure that airport in third country or non-Community air carrier have security requirement that are equivalent to those applied within the European Union and the European Economic Area .
I hope you will be able to endorse Amendment No 22 , nevertheless .
standard certainly need to be developed for an international system of certification .
after all , what honour is there in sentencing a simple minister of Beijing house church to do forced labour ? for three year he had to spend ten to twelve hour a day making football for the upcoming Olympic Games .

( El ) Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your detailed reply .
every one of u can do something too .
it introduces limitation on the fishing effort , allocated to the Member States in proportion to their share in the total allowable catch of cod .
I ask Members of this Parliament , where do you stand on this issue ?
we can show what ha been done .
she did a very good job , a of course , did Mr Grosch , of whom Parliament ha come to expect good report .
we also have an EU that is buying building around Europe in the belief that it is cheaper .
what incentive for reform is left , after all , when the pressure is taken off , if it is guaranteed that accession is going to go ahead anyway ?
the EU , for it part , ha suggested a 25 % reduction in the number of people living in poverty by 2020 and an allocation of 0.7 % of gross national income to development aid .
we therefore have plenty of excellent opportunity , but also plenty of problem area where cooperation ha to be continued .
these day , the refugee from Abkhazia are putting the thumbscrew on Georgian authority to secure their return home .
I voted wrongly on the conclusion to section 23 .
these are very conservative estimate .
people should not live in small or big prison for their thought .
( HU ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , a my fellow Member , Mr Marinescu , ha already pointed out , the volcanic ash crisis demonstrated that Europe wa neither strategically nor technologically prepared for this situation .
can they do it ?
I am very positive that we are on the right route and I believe that what Parliament ha put forward ha helped to strengthen the methodology , also scrutinising the approach which will be involved in this particular battle .
I think that , overall , despite certain attempt in the area of competition , the basic rule have not changed .
it would do Russia credit to put this on the agenda , so that these human problem can be solved .
while road haulage company will now have to pay the cost of air and noise pollution generated by lorry , Member States will , in return , be obliged to reinvest the revenue obtained from these charge in pan-European transport network and , especially , in more effective and le polluting transport system .
it is destined to be incorporated in to the Treaties and the Commission think this should be fully realised a part of the reorganisation of the treaty we proposed at the Intergovernmental Conference , which we hope the European Council will be able to approve in Nice .
speaking of the implementation period for the Regulation , it is projected to be unjustifiably long .
two declaration were attached to that amendment :
no other country ha ever dared so coarsely and provocatively to ridicule it own promise , disregard it commitment , make fool of government on both side of the Atlantic in so short a time , show such shamelessness in violating human right inside and outside it own domain , and use even dark method - including murder - to promote it own shady interest .
at present there is a conflict between the Board of the shipyard and the European Commission , which is demanding a drastic reduction in the shipyard & apos ; s capacity and the closure of two slipway , or else the refund of state aid .
this should bring u one step closer to a more sustainable transport system .
thing are not running quite a smoothly a we imagine them to be there either .
where there are no forest , then we can grow willow and miscanthus to make sure that we can produce energy supply .
we are told that the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaties , which would render it binding at European level , would not give the Union any additional competence .
when we discus and even criticise the effort of the United States to eradicate tyranny and support democracy in Iraq and elsewhere , we must not ignore the game of Russia and China in the region , which may easily end up transforming the region into a burning crater of global terrorist war .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I would like to welcome you here to the European Parliament .
( it ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , woman have always had an important role in the agricultural and rural sector .
however , it eventually decided that the revised text did not involve harmonisation procedure , which are covered by Article 100A . a a result , the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens & apos ; Rights agrees entirely that Article 235 provides an appropriate legal base .
incidentally , this week , we are also proposing a new European mechanism for financial stability .
also , the peace settlement doe not apply to west Darfur , since Arab nomad and solder have driven out most of the black population to neighbouring Chad .
I take up your invitation Mr President and I should look forward to the visit very much .
let me address the two issue on our agenda today one after the other .
we must therefore concentrate on a thorough analysis and examination of current trend , focusing on using new rule to restrict those technology and those possibility which violate the privacy of family and the privacy of child , and which damage the healthy development of the family , and we must apply these rule consistently .
however , having said that , our group will not be able to support this report in tomorrow & apos ; s vote , partly indeed because of this presumption that trade in service is essentially exactly the same a trade in good .
all in all , it is the Commission & apos ; s intention to transfer more responsibility to the Member States in the custom field .
the Commission understands the concern that have motivated the request for a split vote , but feel that the current text address these concern sufficiently .
now , five year later , we see that the new Commission ha chosen to ignore all of these finding that are so important to our survival .
it is difficult to explain to the European public why , for example , the Prince of Monaco or large multinationals such a Heineken and Nestlé receive hundred of thousand of euro in income support in the form of agricultural subsidy merely because they own some land , whilst real farmer often struggle to make end meet .
these election were about encouraging politician to follow the instruction and recommendation of the military , the & apos ; new & apos ; ally of imperialism in the region .
are there any comment ?
I am delighted that all but one of my amendment were accepted in committee , but I would like to point out that the text in recital K is not quite correct .
this proposal confines itself to merely codifying the existing text , without any change in their substance .
the vision that the Commission ha just outlined , of a more socially orientated Europe in the 21st century , is conceptually flawless but bereft of any actual legislative initiative .
opposition to this Treaty is mainly from the far right and some on the extreme left of this House .
a re-evaluation of the additive should therefore be carried out every ten year , taking account of new scientific information and research data .
we need concrete progress in important area , of which I will cite just a few .
yet these people can not be reached in the tried and true manner , directly through the traditional network of commercial bank , because these target group are suspicious of the above instrument , and a already mentioned , they are not able to enter the free market .
( I am proud to have be granted the opportunity to serve the people of Connaught-Ulster , Ireland .
in this connection , however , we have to view new benefit for Members with some reservation .
we have also renewed our support for a free Internet by condemning Internet censorship and the threat that it pose to human right , a well a to access to and sharing of global cultural heritage .
my report deal with this regulation and , a ha been said , it concern a key mechanism in the implementation of the European Union & apos ; s goal of free movement of people in that it coordinate social security system .
it is time that our Parliament blew the whistle to bring an end to this little game .
we know they are true from our experience .
I can therefore only warn the Commission not to take these step .
the gunman tied him and his wife to a chair and , a she pleaded for their life , the Brigade member told her : & apos ; his time ha come & apos ; .
however , a many speaker have said , despite what the Council may say about the importance of education and despite the Commission & apos ; s good faith regarding lifelong learning , there is a lack of commitment on financial resource .
the goal have been set of reducing the school drop-out rate to below 10 % and enabling 40 % of young people to complete higher education by 2020 .
after rice , wheat and maize , banana are the world & apos ; s fourth most important food crop .
what specious reasoning we are hearing from the well-meaning , open-minded Left , however !
Mr President , on behalf of my group I should like to congratulate Mrs RothBehrendt .
although the Dutch policy of tolerance is at least pragmatic , this proposal by the Council is also completely absurd in practice , since it is impossible to govern with amount written in stone .
far from being innocent , this report is dangerous for the freedom and right of the people .
in this context , however , we must not overlook the various initiative to pave the way for so-called giga- or megaliners , which are associated with high infrastructure cost .
with EUR 425 million le ?
in order to restore the citizen & apos ; confidence in Europe , we must make the institution of this Convention more transparent , more efficient and more democratic .
in fact , it complicates the Transatlantic Alliance , produce no additional troop and ha no real purpose , except to shift defence and security decision-making responsibility away from NATO headquarters - where European country sit around the same table a our American ally - to the European Union , from which Americans are specifically excluded .
it did not have a legal basis because the Commission should have presented to Parliament an evaluation of the measure financed by the Community under this line a far back a October 2000 and proposed a new regulation .
the first concern the European Investment Bank .
we must support this compromise which wa accepted by 72 % of the committee .
we did not witness such barbarity even in the darkest Middle Ages .
a we have just seen in the debate on Ireland , certain country must not be allowed to set lower tax rate in order to attract business and then , when they get into financial difficulty , to call on other country to finance their budget deficit , if I can put this in such a simplistic way .
I therefore have another question to put to both the Commission and the Council .
in the area of funding , the report encourages the use of Structural Funds in support of energy efficiency , and call for this to be made a priority within the EU budget after 2013 .
these proposal are downright unfair , to say the very least .
this is not about organising party according to a single , standardised structure , but about following a more general model .
it acceptance by the majority of the House will depend on the adoption of important amendment .
secondly , I would like to mention that our committee wish to maintain all it amendment at this stage , especially those relating to Eurostat .
we see from the supplementary and amending budget that the agreement we reached with the Commission are simply not being applied .
but the bearing of arm is also subject to restriction , and these restriction are exceeded in the US plan , which have now been leaked , concerning the use of nuclear weapon .
our proposal will also make the law enforcement process more manageable by facilitating access to information .
Mr President , I do not think that any of u here are contesting whether or not there should be an ivory trade : of course there should not .
I shall end with a particularly important issue raised , that of consumer information .
should we not be setting the cost of disposing of animal by-product against what it will cost European farmer if there is a renewed outbreak of BSE in their herd or - worse still - if people start falling ill ?
my second point is that Europe must finally provide itself with the instrument necessary to retain or recover production capacity , for example industrial or agricultural production capacity , and to retain - and this is absolutely vital for it future - it technological progress .
the PPE-DE Group is putting forward it own resolution and is not able to support the resolution by the other political group , which emphasise widening the campaign to include anti-tank mine and other category of munition .
the euro , of course , limited the potential for & apos ; stray & apos ; capital to speculate on exchange rate .
in modifying the existing common consular instruction , it provides firstly for the obligation to supply biometrics which will be stored in the vi and the standard for doing so , but secondly it includes provision on the organisation of receiving visa application .
let there be no mistake about it .
I would like to welcome the host of issue raised by this report , which ha enabled u , regardless of the committee we are working in , to find a series of correlation which need to be achieved so that we make a greater contribution to achieving the EU 2020 target .
on the contrary , I believe that , in many area , we have succeeded in making progress and finding compromise that are acceptable to everyone .
we do not wish to see agricultural policy returned to national control , or appropriation for the Structural Funds remaining unaltered , with the same amount of money being distributed between a greater number of country .
in another important aspect of our north-south cooperation , however , we must try to encourage the cultivation of alternative crop to get off the ground .
such success wa not self-evident .
with regard to the impact of Basel III on both major and smaller bank , generally speaking , we will proceed very carefully with macro- and micro-economic impact study , without improvising , and I will use all flexibility margin in order to develop good measure and good decision that are a well-gauged a possible .
indeed , we need a strong impetus , expertise and a decision timetable which the European Central Bank could draw up and which the Council of Ministers for the euro area , presided by your good self , Mr Juncker , could then adopt and implement .
( BG ) Thank you , Mr President .
furthermore , around 900 million people are chronically hungry due to extreme poverty , while up to 2 billion people lack genuine , long-term food security due to varying degree of poverty .
in turn , defence is constantly changing it boundary in a world in which the perception of these is ever more blurred : nowadays , we can not only consider the territorial defence of one State faced with a possible attack by another , but rather , a ha been correctly said , we have army that lack clear enemy and enemy that lack army .
in the calendar proposed , there is a reference to the date of the election in 2009 .
I have my own thought for you also .
the Commission appreciates that citizen and worker need to feel secure in this difficult time .
it would be wrong to oppose the directive because it doe not give sufficient right of information and consultation .
that is why I voted for the report on the European Joint undertaking for ITER and the Development of fusion Energy .
for example , one achievement is that all of the excessive deficit in the euro area have been corrected .
I would therefore like to ask the European Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of money spent on the fight against HIV / AIDS .
( heckling )
the main legal problem arises when the public authority continues to deny all the other company the opportunity to provide those service in the same area , in a situation of transparent and honest competition .
we must not treat it like a commercial item and operate a policy under which the biggest business is the purchase of agricultural land and it alienation from agricultural production for other purpose .
whereas a few year ago it wa predicted that by 1998 there would be three million user in Europe , when 1998 came we realised that there were already 18 million , and this growth is still continuing .
by voting through this amendment now a part of Amendment No 188 , Parliament would make clear that such Member States could not expect the benefit of hosting such new agency if they are not prepared to exercise their responsibility .
it should be pointed out that the Commission ha accepted such withdrawal in the past and ha consequently terminated investigation without taking measure .
someone said that the guilty party should be condemned ; well , you will be dining with one of them tonight - with President Putin himself .
Chancellor Gordon Brown wa asked how much funding wa to be allocated to the military action and his answer wa & apos ; a much a it take & apos ; .
the future we desire will come about through fundamental technological development , a well a through action that we can all carry out , starting today .
well , I believe a reference to the founding value of Europe , an explicit reference to Christian value , would be a contribution to our history .
the factual evidence on PR suggests that , bearing in mind the spoilt ballot paper that remain in each Member State that ha PR , large number of voter reject it at every election .
( RO ) Given that energy efficiency is one of the priority area for the EU & apos ; s economic recovery and for combating climate change , I feel that it is necessary to set up a European fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy to raise the public and private fund for implementing specific project across the European Union . this would provide a model of efficiency for using European public money .
it is therefore important to take advantage of the possibility for peaceful and constructive exchange of view a part of a process of dialogue within ACP region and country involving government and civil society .
we must therefore spread this kind of awareness-raising initiative in order to combat discriminatory attitude and to ensure that the citizen are kept informed about their right and obligation .
there are only a few of u left now , this being the third reading .
I have returned from Porto Alegre , and I can tell you that the Brazilians and Argentinians whom I met there admit that they have been doing the same thing in various place , namely feeding animal carcass to cattle .
the initial amendment wa apparently mistranslated into German to mean exactly the opposite of what the English said because the English text wa ambiguous .
I would like to ask the representative of the Council what you think of paragraph 15 and 16 of the report by Mr Tsatsos and Mr Méndez de Vigo . and I would like to ask the representative of the Council to repeat what your Prime Minister , Mr Juncker , said .
the purpose of the treaty change is very specific .
this mean our Parliament run the risk of being dominated , not by the PPE-DE Group or by the Socialist Group , but by AKP Islamists .
Madam President , Commissioner , the great interest which you have witnessed in this House today - even though you yourself are not responsible for fishery - ha , I hope , made it clear how much our idea deserve support , both in the Committee on Fisheries and in the Commission .
a regard aviation , the study wa brought to completion in 2004 .
we are just about to do this , and I count on you to enable u to do it in the course of June , before the summer break .
for the moment we must make a virtue of necessity and live with the existing rule .
the question of earmarking , mentioned by a number of Members this morning , wa discussed at last week & apos ; s trialogue .
it go without saying that Arafat is the one who risk the most and the responsibility of a definitive collapse of this peace process would inevitably end up benefiting those who believe in religious extremism , fundamentalism ; it would thus sweep aside those who have worked for peace , beginning with Arafat himself .
if you look around , how could we find a perfect document ?
