what is Abilify ?
Abilify is a medicine containing the active substance aripiprazole .
it is available a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablet , a 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible tablet ( tablet that dissolve in the mouth ) , a an oral solution ( 1 mg / ml ) and a a solution for injection ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
what is Abilify used for ?
they may also have episode of depression .
Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episode and to prevent manic episode in patient who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the solution for injection is used for the rapid control of agitation or disturbed behaviour when taking the medicine by mouth is not appropriate .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is Abilify used ?
for schizophrenia , the recommended starting dose is 10 or 15 mg by mouth per day .
the maintenance dose is 15 mg once a day , but higher dos may benefit some patient .
for bipolar disorder , the recommended starting dose is 15 mg by mouth once a day , either on it own or in combination with other medicine .
some patient may benefit from a higher dose .
to prevent manic episode , the same dose should be continued .
for both illness , the oral solution or orodispersible tablet can be used in patient who have difficulty swallowing tablet .
the orodispersible tablet are taken by being placed on the tongue , where they disintegrate quickly in the saliva , or by mixing them in water before swallowing .

Abilify ha not been studied in child aged below 18 year or adult aged over 65 year .
for more information , see the Package Leaflet .
how doe Abilify work ?
the active substance in Abilify , aripiprazole , is an antipsychotic medicine .
it exact mechanism of action is unknown , but it attache to several different receptor on the surface of nerve cell in the brain .
this disrupts signal transmitted between brain cell by ‘ neurotransmitter ’ , chemical that allow nerve cell to communicate with each other .
Aripiprazole is thought to act mainly by being a ‘ partial agonist ’ for the receptor for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine ( also called serotonin ) .
this mean that aripiprazole act like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine to activate the receptor , but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter .
since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine are involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , aripiprazole help to normalise the activity of the brain , reducing psychotic or manic symptom and preventing them from returning .
how ha Abilify been studied ?
for the treatment of schizophrenia , there were three main short-term study of Abilify tablet lasting four to six week , which involved 1,203 patient and compared Abilify with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
the effectiveness of Abilify in preventing symptom from returning wa assessed in three study lasting up to a year , two of which used haloperidol ( another antipsychotic medicine ) a a comparator .
the effectiveness of the solution for injection wa compared with placebo over a period of two hour in two study involving 805 patient with schizophrenia or related condition who were experiencing symptom of agitation .
all of the study measured the change in the patient ’ s symptom using a standard scale for schizophrenia .
for the treatment of bipolar disorder , there were eight main study looking at Abilify taken by mouth .
there were five short-term study that compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo over three week in a total of 1,900 patient .
two of these study used haloperidol and lithium ( another antipsychotic medicine ) a comparators and continued for a further nine week to look at the maintenance of the effect of the medicine .
another study compared Abilify with haloperidol over 12 week in 347 patient , and a further study compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo in preventing recurrence in 160 patient whose manic symptom had already been stabilised using Abilify .
the eighth study looked at the effect of adding Abilify or placebo to existing treatment with lithium or valproate ( another antipsychotic medicine ) in 384 patient .
the effectiveness of Abilify solution for injection wa compared with that of lorazepam ( another antipsychotic medicine ) and of placebo over a period of two hour in one study involving 301 patient with bipolar disorder who were experiencing symptom of agitation .
all of these study looked at the change in symptom using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or at the number of patient who responded to treatment .
the company also carried out study looking at the absorption of the orodispersible tablet and oral solution by the body .
what benefit ha Abilify shown during the study ?
when used to treat schizophrenia , Abilify wa more effective than placebo in the short-term study .
in the long-term study , Abilify wa more effective than placebo , and a effective a haloperidol , after up to a year of treatment .
in both study of the solution for injection , patient receiving Abilify at dos of 5.25 , 9.75 or 15 mg had a significantly greater reduction in symptom of agitation than those receiving placebo .
when used to treat bipolar disorder , Abilify wa more effective than placebo at reducing manic symptom in four of the five short-term study .
Abilify also had a similar effect to haloperidol and to lithium over three week .
this effect wa maintained for up to 12 week .
Abilify wa also more effective than placebo at preventing manic episode returning in previously treated patient for up to 74 week , and when it wa used a an add-on to existing treatment .
injection of Abilify at dos of 10 or 15 mg were also more effective than placebo in reducing the symptom of agitation , and were of similar effectiveness to lorazepam .
2 / 3 What is the risk associated with Abilify ?
Akathisia is more common in patient with bipolar disorder than in those with schizophrenia .
between 1 and 10 patient in 100 receiving injection of Abilify experience somnolence , dizziness , headache , akathisia , nausea and vomiting .
for the full list of all side effect reported with Abilify , see the Package Leaflet .
Abilify should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to aripiprazole or any of the other ingredient .
why ha Abilify been approved ?
the Committee for medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Abilify ’ s benefit are greater than it risk for the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder , and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment .
it also decided that the benefit of the solution for injection outweighed it risk for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviour in patient with schizophrenia or in patient with manic episode in bipolar I disorder , when oral therapy is not appropriate .
the Committee recommended that Abilify be given marketing authorisation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
child and adolescent : there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendation .
however , the
2 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established .
owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
when the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitored throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or le duration , there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered
3 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
if a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death were varied , most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatality , were reported in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference wa not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treated with any antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY , should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY .
when seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterised by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4 4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax wa unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected .
following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) wa administered alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
5 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk .
patient should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machine , including motor vehicle , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the following undesirable effect occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
6 Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS wa 26.6 % for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0 % of patient who received placebo .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have been received with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
8 It ha been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patient , presenting with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoint , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 week .
these trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
there is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum protein , binding primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
based on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily hepatic .
following a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
le than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % wa recovered unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subject , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subject .
10 Hepatic Disease :
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure ( based on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
child and adolescent : there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendation .
however , the
13 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established .
owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
when the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitored throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or le duration , there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered
14 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
if a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death were varied , most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatality , were reported in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference wa not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treated with any antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY , should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY .
when seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterised by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
15 4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax wa unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected .
following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) wa administered alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
16 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk .
patient should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machine , including motor vehicle , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the following undesirable effect occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
17 Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .

in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS wa 26.6 % for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0 % of patient who received placebo .

the potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
19 It ha been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patient , presenting with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoint , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 week .
these trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
there is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum protein , binding primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
based on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily hepatic .
following a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
le than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % wa recovered unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subject , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subject .
21 Hepatic Disease :
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure ( based on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
child and adolescent : there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendation .
however , the
24 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established .
owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
when the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitored throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or le duration , there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered
25 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
if a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death were varied , most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatality , were reported in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference wa not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treated with any antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY , should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY .
when seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterised by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
26 4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax wa unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected .
following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) wa administered alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
27 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk .
patient should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machine , including motor vehicle , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the following undesirable effect occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
28 Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS wa 26.6 % for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0 % of patient who received placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have been received with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
30 It ha been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patient , presenting with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoint , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 week .
these trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
there is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum protein , binding primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
based on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily hepatic .
following a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
le than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % wa recovered unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subject , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subject .
32 Hepatic Disease :
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure ( based on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
child and adolescent : there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendation .
however , the
35 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established .
owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
when the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitored throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or le duration , there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered
36 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
if a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death were varied , most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatality , were reported in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference wa not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treated with any antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY , should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY .
when seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterised by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
37 4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax wa unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected .
following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) wa administered alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
38 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk .
patient should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machine , including motor vehicle , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the following undesirable effect occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
39 Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS wa 26.6 % for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0 % of patient who received placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have been received with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
41 It ha been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patient , presenting with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoint , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 week .
these trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
there is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum protein , binding primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
based on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily hepatic .
following a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
le than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % wa recovered unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :

5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure ( based on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
the orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
it can be taken with or without liquid .
removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
46 The orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to ABILIFY tablet for patient who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablet ( see also section 5.2 ) .
child and adolescent : there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendation .
in these patient dosing should be managed cautiously .
however , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established .
owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
when the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitored throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
47 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or le duration , there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
in clinical trial , rare case of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
if a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death were varied , most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatality , were reported in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference wa not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treated with any antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY , should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY .
when seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
48 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Phenylketonurics :
ABILIFY orodispersible tablet contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterised by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax wa unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean
49 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
when either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk .
patient should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machine , including motor vehicle , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the following undesirable effect occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS wa 26.6 % for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0 % of patient who received placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have been received with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
52 activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
it ha been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patient , presenting with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoint , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
these trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
in a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum level , the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablet , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to aripiprazole tablet .
absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
there is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum protein , binding primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
based on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily hepatic .
following a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
le than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % wa recovered unchanged in the faeces .
54 Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subject , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subject .
Hepatic Disease :
a single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure ( based on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
the orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
it can be taken with or without liquid .
removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
58 The orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to ABILIFY tablet for patient who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablet ( see also section 5.2 ) .
child and adolescent : there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendation .
in these patient dosing should be managed cautiously .
however , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established .
owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
when the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitored throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
59 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or le duration , there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
in clinical trial , rare case of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
if a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death were varied , most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatality , were reported in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference wa not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treated with any antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY , should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY .
when seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
60 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Phenylketonurics :
ABILIFY orodispersible tablet contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterised by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax wa unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean
61 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
when either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk .
patient should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machine , including motor vehicle , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the following undesirable effect occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS wa 26.6 % for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0 % of patient who received placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have been received with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
64 activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
it ha been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patient , presenting with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoint , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
these trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
in a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum level , the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablet , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to aripiprazole tablet .
absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
there is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum protein , binding primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
based on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily hepatic .
following a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
le than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % wa recovered unchanged in the faeces .
66 Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subject , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subject .
Hepatic Disease :
a single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure ( based on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a higher dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
the orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
it can be taken with or without liquid .
removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
70 The orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to ABILIFY tablet for patient who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablet ( see also section 5.2 ) .
child and adolescent : there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendation .
in these patient dosing should be managed cautiously .
however , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established .
owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
when the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitored throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
71 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or le duration , there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
in clinical trial , rare case of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
if a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death were varied , most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatality , were reported in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference wa not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treated with any antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY , should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY .
when seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
72 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Phenylketonurics :
ABILIFY orodispersible tablet contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterised by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax wa unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean
73 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
when either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk .
patient should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machine , including motor vehicle , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the following undesirable effect occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS wa 26.6 % for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0 % of patient who received placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have been received with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
76 activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
it ha been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patient , presenting with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoint , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
these trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
in a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum level , the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablet , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to aripiprazole tablet .
absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
there is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum protein , binding primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
based on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily hepatic .
following a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
le than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % wa recovered unchanged in the faeces .
78 Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subject , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subject .
Hepatic Disease :
a single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure ( based on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient ( see section 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
when the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitored throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
83 Tardive dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or le duration , there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
in clinical trial , rare case of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
if a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death were varied , most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatality , were reported in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference wa not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treated with any antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY , should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY .
when seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
84 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
intolerance :
the oral solution contains fructose .
patient with rare hereditary problem of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product .
the oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may cause allergic reaction ( possibly delayed ) .
the oral solution contains sucrose .
patient with rare hereditary problem of fructose intolerance , glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the oral solution .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterised by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax wa unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
85 When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected .
following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) wa administered alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
when either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk .
patient should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machine , including motor vehicle , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the following undesirable effect occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .

in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS wa 26.6 % for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0 % of patient who received placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have been received with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
88 activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma protein .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
it ha been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patient , presenting with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoint , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
these trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
there is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum protein , binding primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
based on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily hepatic .
following a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
le than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % wa recovered unchanged in the faeces .
oral solution :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally a the solution .
at equivalent dos , the peak plasma concentration of aripiprazole ( Cmax ) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic
in a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole a the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablet in healthy subject , the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax value wa 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
the single- dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear and dose-proportional .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subject , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subject .
Hepatic Disease :
a single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , were
91 observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure ( based on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

simultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotic and parenteral benzodiazepine may be associated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression .
if parenteral benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection , patient should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension ( see section 4.5 ) .
patient receiving aripiprazole solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension .
blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly .
the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection ha not been evaluated in patient with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication ( either with prescribed or illicit medicinal product ) .
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitored throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or le duration , there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
in clinical trial , rare case of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
if a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death were varied , most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatality , were reported in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference wa not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treated with any antipsychotic agent , including ABILIFY , should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
96 weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY .
when seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterised by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
the administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole solution for injection when administered concomitantly .
however , in a single-dose , intramuscular study of aripiprazole ( dose 15 mg ) in healthy subject , administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam ( dose 2 mg ) , the intensity of sedation wa greater with the combination a compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone .
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax wa unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied .
97 upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected .
following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) wa administered alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
when either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
the administration of aripiprazole solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly .
however , in a single-dose , intramuscular study of aripiprazole ( dose 15 mg ) in healthy subject , administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam ( dose 2 mg ) , the orthostatic hypotension observed wa greater with the combination a compared to that observed with lorazepam alone .
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk .
patient should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machine , including motor vehicle , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely .
98 4.8 undesirable effect
the following undesirable effect occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) in clinical trial with aripiprazole solution for injection ( see section 5.1 ) :

in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS wa 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
99 comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0 % of patient who received placebo .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have been received with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
it ha been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
101 Further information on clinical trial :
in two short- term ( 24-hour ) placebo-controlled trial involving 554 schizophrenic patient presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviour , aripiprazole solution for injection wa associated with statistically significant greater improvement in agitation / behavioural symptom compared to placebo and wa similar to haloperidol .
in one short-term ( 24-hour ) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patient with bipolar disorder presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviour , aripiprazole solution for injection wa associated with statistically significant greater improvement in agitation / behavioural symptom compared to placebo and wa similar to the reference arm lorazepam .
the observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS excitement component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint wa 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for lorazepam , and 8.7 for aripiprazole .
in subpopulation analysis on patient with mixed episode or on patient with severe agitation , a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population wa observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced sample size .
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patient , presenting with positive or negative symptom , oral aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group ( oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on oral aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for oral haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoint , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , oral aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial oral aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder with oral aripiprazole :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 week .
these trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole solution for injection administered intramuscularly a a single-dose to healthy subject is well absorbed and ha an absolute bioavailability of 100 % .
the aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hour after an intramuscular injection wa 90 % greater than the AUC after the same dose a a tablet ; systemic exposure wa generally similar between the 2 formulation .
in 2 study in healthy subject the median time to the peak plasma concentration were 1 and 3 hour after dosing .
distribution :
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum protein , binding primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
based on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily hepatic .
following a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
le than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % wa recovered unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subject , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
103 renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subject .
Hepatic Disease :
a single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
administration of aripiprazole solution for injection wa well tolerated and produced no direct target organ toxicity in rat or monkey after repeated dosing at systemic exposure ( AUC ) that were 15 and 5 time , respectively , human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg intramuscular .
in intravenous reproductive toxicity study , no new safety concern were observed at maternal exposure up to 15 ( rat ) and 29 ( rabbit ) time human exposure at 30 mg .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional oral aripiprazole study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure ( based on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public assessment Report ( EPAR ) .
it explains how the Committee for medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the study performed , to reach their recommendation on how to use the medicine .
if you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
if you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendation , read the Scientific discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Abraxane ?
Abraxane is a powder that is made up into a suspension for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
it contains the active substance paclitaxel ( 5 mg / ml ) .
what is Abraxane used for ?
Abraxane is used to treat metastatic breast cancer in patient whose first treatment for their metastatic disease ha stopped working and for whom standard treatment including an ‘ anthracycline ’ ( a type of anticancer medicine ) is not suitable . ‘ Metastatic ’ mean that the cancer ha spread to other part of the body .
Abraxane is used on it own .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is Abraxane used ?
Abraxane should only be given under the supervision of a specialist cancer doctor in ward that are specialised in giving ‘ cytotoxic ’ ( cell-killing ) medicine .
the recommended dose is 260 mg per square metre of body surface area ( calculated using the patient ’ s height and weight ) .
it is given over a period of 30 minute , every three week .
the dose may be reduced or treatment interrupted in patient who have certain side effect affecting the blood or the nerve .
Abraxane should not be used in patient who have severe problem with their liver .
the appropriate dos for patient with mild or moderate liver problem or with kidney problem are not known .
how doe Abraxane work ?
the active substance in Abraxane , paclitaxel , belongs to the group of anticancer medicine known a the ‘ taxanes ’ .
Paclitaxel block the ability of cancer cell to break down their internal ‘ skeleton ’ that allows them to divide and multiply .
with their skeleton still in place , the cell can not divide and they eventually die .
Abraxane also affect non-cancer cell such a blood and nerve cell , which can cause side effect .
Paclitaxel ha been available a an anticancer medicine since 1993 .
conventional type of paclitaxel contain substance ( solvent ) that dissolve the paclitaxel , but can cause side effect .
Abraxane doe not contain these solvent .

EU © EMEA 2007 reproduction and / or distribution of this document is authorised for non commercial purpose only provided the EMEA is acknowledged body , and therefore it benefit and risk , in comparison with conventional medicine containing paclitaxel .
how ha Abraxane been studied ?
the effect of Abraxane were first tested in experimental model before being studied in human .
the company also presented data from the published literature .
the effectiveness of Abraxane ha been studied in one main study involving 460 woman with metastatic breast cancer , around three-quarters of whom had received an anthracycline in the past .
around half of the patient in the study had already received treatment for their cancer after it had become metastatic .
the effect of Abraxane ( given on it own ) were compared with those of a conventional paclitaxel- containing medicine ( given together with other medicine to reduce side effect ) .
the main measure of effectiveness wa the number of patient who ‘ responded ’ after at least five week of treatment .
this wa defined a the patient ’ s main tumour having disappeared or having shrunk in size by at least 30 % .
what benefit ha Abraxane shown during the study ?
Abraxane wa more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicine .
overall , in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 woman receiving Abraxane responded to treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 receiving conventional paclitaxel-containing medicine .
when looking only at the patient who were receiving their first treatment for metastatic breast cancer , there wa no difference between the medicine in term of measure of effectiveness such a the time until the disease got worse and survival .
in contrast , in patient who had taken other treatment for metastatic breast cancer before , these additional measure showed that Abraxane wa more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicine .
therefore , the company withdrew it application for the use of Abraxane a first-line treatment during the assessment of the medicine .
what is the risk associated with Abraxane ?
for the full list of all side effect reported with Abraxane , see the Package Leaflet .
Abraxane should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredient .
it should also not be used in patient who are breast feeding or who have low level of neutrophil in the blood before starting treatment .
why ha Abraxane been approved ?
the Committee for medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) noted that Abraxane wa more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicine in patient whose first treatment had stopped working , and that , unlike other paclitaxel-containing medicine , it doe not need other medicine to reduce side effect .
the Committee decided that Abraxane ’ s benefit are greater than it risk for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patient who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated .
the Committee recommended that Abraxane be given marketing authorisation .
other information about Abraxane :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Abraxane to Abraxis BioScience limited on 11 January 2008 .

4.1 Therapeutic indication
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patient who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated ( See also section 4.4 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Abraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in unit specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agent .
the procedure for reconstitution is described in section 6.6 .
the recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg / m2 administered intravenously over 30 minute every 3 week .
dose adjustment during treatment :
patient who experience severe neutropenia ( neutrophil count & lt ; 0.50 X 109 / l for a week or longer ) or severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg / m2 for subsequent course .
following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy , additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg / m2 .
Abraxane should not be administered until neutrophil count recover to & gt ; 1.5 X 109 / l .
for grade 3 sensory neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to grade 1 or 2 , followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent course .
2 patient with hepatic impairment :
insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modification in patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( see section 4.4. and 5.2 ) .
patient with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel .
patient with impaired renal function :
study in patient with impaired renal function have not been performed and insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modification in patient with renal impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
paediatric patient :
Abraxane is not recommended for use in child below age 18 year due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
elderly patient :
in the clinical study , no toxicity occurred notably more frequently among elderly patient who received Abraxane .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Lactation .
patient who have baseline neutrophil count & lt ; 1.5 X 109 / l .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel , which may have substantially different pharmacological property compared to other formulation of paclitaxel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) ..
Hypersensitivity :
if hypersensitivity occurs , the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately , symptomatic treatment should be initiated , and that patient should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel .
Haematology :
bone marrow suppression ( primarily neutropenia ) occurs frequently with Abraxane .
Neutropenia is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity .
frequent monitoring of blood cell count should be performed during Abraxane therapy .
patient should not be retreated with subsequent cycle of Abraxane until neutrophil recover to & gt ; 1.5 X 109 / l and platelet recover to & gt ; 100 X 109 / l .
Neuropathy :
Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with Abraxane , although development of severe symptom is le common .
the occurrence of grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy doe not generally require dose reduction .
if grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops , treatment should be withheld until resolution to grade 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent course of Abraxane is recommended ( see section 4.2 ) .
3 Hepatic impairment :
patient with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity , particularly from myelosuppression , and such patient should be closely monitored for development of profound myelosuppression .
the use of Abraxane ha not been formally studied in patient specifically with hepatic impairment .
patient with severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin & gt ; 5 X ULN or ASL / ALT & gt ; 10 X ULN ) should not be treated with Abraxane .
the appropriate dose regimen in patient with le severe hepatic impairment is unknown .
Cardiotoxicity :
while cardiotoxicity unequivocally related to Abraxane ha not been demonstrated , cardiac event are not uncommon in the indicated population , especially in patient who have previously received anthracyclines or have underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease .
thus patient receiving Abraxane should be vigilantly monitored by physician for the occurrence of cardiac event .
sexually active men and woman should use effective method of contraception during treatment and up to six month after treatment for men , and one month after treatment for woman ( see section 4.6 ) .
the effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patient with central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis ha not been established .
CNS metastasis are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy .
Gastrointestinal symptom :
if patient experience nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane , they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agent .
Excipients :
when reconstituted , Abraxane contains approximately 425 mg sodium per dose .
to be taken into consideration by patient on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no interaction study have been performed .
the metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed , in part , by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 ( see section 5.2 ) .
therefore , caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicine known to inhibit ( E. G. erythromycin , fluoxetine , imidazole antifungal ) or induce ( E. G. rifampicin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , efavirenz , nevirapine ) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 .
Abraxane is indicated for mono-therapy .
Abraxane should not be used in combination with other anticancer agent .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
pregnancy :
there are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy .
Paclitaxel is suspected to cause serious birth defect when administered during pregnancy .
study in animal have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy , and in woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception , unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel .
4 Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving treatment with Abraxane .
male patient treated with Abraxane are advised not to father a child during and up to six month after treatment .
it is not known if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk .
because of potential serious adverse reaction in breast-feeding infant , Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation .
breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of therapy .
Abraxane induced infertility in male rat ( see section 5.3 ) .
male patient should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abraxane ha minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
Abraxane may cause side effect such a tiredness ( very common ) and dizziness ( common ) that may affect the ability to drive and use machinery .
patient should be advised not to drive and use machine if they feel tired or dizzy .
4.8 undesirable effect
the following are the most common and important incidence of adverse reaction related to 229 patient with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane once every three week in the pivotal phase III clinical study .

Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reaction is calculated based on one definitely related case in a population of 789 patient
Post-marketing experience
Cranial nerve palsy , vocal cord paresis , and rare report of severe hypersensitivity reaction have been reported during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane .
in some patient previously exposed to capecitabine , report of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported a part of the continuing surveillance of Abraxane .
because these event have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , true estimate of frequency can not be made and a causal relationship to the event ha not been established .
4.9 overdose
there is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose .
in the event of an overdose , the patient should be closely monitored .
treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicity , which are bone marrow suppression , mucositis and peripheral neuropathy .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Taxanes , ATC Code :
L01CD01
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubule from tubulin dimer and stabilises microtubule by preventing depolymerisation .
this stability result in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular function .
in addition , paclitaxel induces abnormal array or “ bundle ” of microtubule throughout the cell cycle and multiple aster of microtubule during mitosis .
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles .
Albumin is known to mediate endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituent and in vitro study demonstrated that the presence of albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cell .
it is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor , and that there is accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC ( secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine ) .
breast carcinoma :
data from 106 patient accrued in two single-arm open-label study and from 454 patient treated in a randomised phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer .
this information is presented below .
Single-arm open-label study
in one study , Abraxane wa administered a a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg / m2 to 43 patient with metastatic breast cancer .
the second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg / m2 a a 30 minute infusion in 63 patient with metastatic breast cancer .
patient were treated without steroid pre- treatment or planned G-CSF support .
cycle were administered at 3 week interval .
the response rate in all patient were 39.5 % ( 95 % CI :
24.9 % - 54.2 % ) and 47.6 %
35.3 % - 60.0 % ) , respectively .
the median time to disease progression wa 5.3 month ( 175 mg / m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.6 – 6.2 month ) and 6.1 month ( 300 mg / m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.2 – 9.8 month ) .
Randomised comparative study :
Sixty-four percent of patient had impaired performance status ( ECOG 1 or 2 ) at study entry ; 79 % had visceral metastasis ; and 76 % had & gt ; 3 site of metastasis .
fourteen percent of the patient had not received prior chemotherapy ; 27 % had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only , 40 % in the metastatic setting only , and 19 % in both metastatic and adjuvant setting .
Fifty-nine percent received study medicinal product a second or greater than second-line therapy .
Seventy-seven percent of the patient had been previously exposed to anthracyclines .
result for overall response rate and time to disease progression , and progression-free survival and survival for patient receiving & gt ; 1st-line therapy , are shown below .

9 229 patient treated with Abraxane in the randomized , controlled clinical trial were evaluated for safety .
Neurotoxictiy to paclitaxel wa evaluated through improvement by one grade for patient experiencing grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after & gt ; 6 course of treatment wa not evaluated and remains unknown .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
the pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane at dose level of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical study .
the drug exposure ( AUC ) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng . hr / ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patient with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , paclitaxel plasma concentration declined in a multiphasic manner .
the mean Cmax of paclitaxel , which occurred at the end of the infusion , wa 18.7 µg / ml .
the mean total clearance wa 15 l / hr / m2 .
the terminal half-life wa about 27 hour .
the mean volume of distribution wa 632 l / m2 ; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and / or tissue binding of paclitaxel .
in a study in patient with advanced solid tumour , the pharmacokinetic characteristic of paclitaxel following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg / m2 over 30 minute were compared with those following 175 mg / m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hour .
the clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane wa larger ( 43 % ) than that following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and it volume of distribution wa also higher ( 53 % ) .
difference in Cmax and Cmax corrected for dose reflected difference in total dose and rate of infusion .
there were no difference in terminal half-lives .
the protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane administration is estimated at about 90 % .
based on the published literature , in vitro study of binding to human serum protein , using paclitaxel at concentration ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM , indicate that about 87 % of paclitaxel is bound ; the presence of ranitidine , dexamethasone , or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel .
based on the published literature , in vitro study with human liver microsome and tissue slice show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel ; and to two minor metabolite , 3 ’ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3 ’ -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel .
the formation of these hydroxylated metabolite is catalysed by CYP2C8 , -3A4 , and both -2C8 and -3A4 respectively .
the effect of renal or hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel ha not been formally investigated .
Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patient aged over 65 year seems comparable to that in patient le than 65 year .
however , little information in patient over 75 year is available a only 3 patient over 75 year of age where included in the pharmacokinetic analysis .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
the carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel ha not been studied .
however , based on the published literature , paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical dos , based upon it pharmacodynamic mechanism of action .
Paclitaxel ha been shown to be clastogenic in vitro ( chromosome aberration in human lymphocyte ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mouse ) .
10 in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary / hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( CHO / HGPRT ) gene mutation assay .
Paclitaxel at dos below the human therapeutic dose wa associated with low fertility and foetal toxicity in rat .
animal study with Abraxane showed non-reversible , toxic effect on the male reproductive organ at clinically relevant exposure level .

EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public assessment Report ( EPAR ) .
it explains how the Committee for medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the study performed , to reach their recommendation on how to use the medicine .
if you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
if you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendation , read the Scientific discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Abseamed ?
Abseamed is a solution for injection .
it is available in pre-filled syrinx containing between 1,000 and 10,000 international unit ( IU ) of the active substance , epoetin alfa .
Abseamed is a ‘ biosimilar ’ medicine .
this mean that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also known a the ‘ reference medicine ’ ) .
the reference medicine for Abseamed is Eprex / Erypo .
for more information on biosimilar medicine , see the question-and-answer document here .
what is Abseamed used for ?
it is used in patient with normal blood iron level who could experience complication if they were to receive a blood transfusion , if they do not have the opportunity to donate their own blood before surgery and are expected to lose 900 to 1,800 ml of blood .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is Abseamed used ?
treatment with Abseamed must be started under the supervision of a doctor who ha experience in the management of patient with the condition that the medicine is used for .
for patient with kidney problem and patient who are going to donate their own blood , Abseamed must be injected into a vein .
patient receiving chemotherapy or about to undergo orthopaedic surgery receive it under the skin .
Abseamed can be injected under the skin by the patient or their carer if they

for full detail , see the Package Leaflet .
how doe Abseamed work ?
a hormone called erythropoietin stimulates the production of red blood cell from the bone marrow .
in patient receiving chemotherapy or with kidney problem , anaemia can be caused by a lack of erythropoietin , or by the body not responding enough to the erythropoietin it ha naturally .
in these case , erythropoietin is used to replace the missing hormone or to increase red blood cell count .
erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cell and help minimise the consequence of blood loss .
the active substance in Abseamed , epoetin alfa , is a copy of human erythropoietin and work in exactly the same way a the natural hormone to stimulate red blood cell production .
the epoetin alfa in Abseamed is produced by ‘ recombinant DNA technology ’ : it is made by a cell that ha received a gene ( DNA ) , which make it able to produce epoetin alfa .
how ha Abseamed been studied ?
Abseamed wa studied to show that it is comparable with the reference medicine , Eprex / Erypo , in experimental model and in human .
Abseamed , injected into a vein , wa compared with the reference medicine in one main study involving 479 patient with anaemia caused by kidney problem .
all of the patient had been taking Eprex / Erypo injected into a vein for at least eight week before they were either switched to Abseamed or remained on Eprex / Erypo .
the main measure of effectiveness wa the change in the level of haemoglobin between the start of the study and the evaluation period , between week 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the result of a study comparing the effect of Abseamed injected under the skin with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patient who were receiving chemotherapy .
what benefit ha Abseamed shown during the study ?
Abseamed wa a effective a Eprex / Erypo in increasing and maintaining red blood cell count .
in the study of patient with anaemia caused by kidney problem , patient switching to Abseamed maintained haemoglobin level to the same extent a those continuing to take Eprex / Erypo .
on average , the level of the patient taking Abseamed increased by 0.147 g / dl from a starting value of 11.7 g / dl .
in comparison , those continuing to take Eprex / Erypo had an increase of 0.063 g / dl from a starting value of 12.0 g / dl .
the study in patient receiving chemotherapy showed that Abseamed wa also a effective a Eprex / Erypo when it wa injected under the skin .
what is the risk associated with Abseamed ?
the most common side effect with Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure , which can sometimes lead to symptom of encephalopathy ( brain problem ) such a sudden , stabbing migraine-like headache and confusion .
Abseamed can also lead to skin rash and flu-like symptom .
for the full list of all side effect reported with Abseamed , see the Package Leaflet .
Abseamed should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredient .
Abseamed is not recommended for injection under the skin in the treatment of kidney problem because further study are needed to make sure that this doe not cause allergic reaction .
why ha Abseamed been approved ?
the Committee for medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that , in accordance with EU requirement , Abseamed ha been shown to have a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile to Eprex / Erypo .
therefore , the CHMP ’ s view wa that , a for Eprex / Erypo , the benefit outweighs the identified risk .
the Committee recommended that Abseamed be given marketing authorisation .
which measure are being taken to ensure the safe use of Abseamed ?
the company that make Abseamed will provide information pack for healthcare worker in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
the company will also provide cool box for patient , which will include illustration showing how the medicine should be used .

4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
2 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
if it occurs , appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU / kg given by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
3 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg given 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose is 150 IU / kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase is & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin ha increased & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
the recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
5 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / d
and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
12 g / dl )
300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
at the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible , even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
6 The recommended dose is 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given .
care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient .
all patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only .
administer the amount required .
this medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depending on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
in case of larger volume , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
the injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously !
the intravenous route ha to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assured :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
8 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2 .
based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
in cancer patient receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
9 patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
therefore , it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysm , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agent , including patient receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have been observed ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizure , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication ( E. G. stenosis , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
11 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patient .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provided a necessary .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected .
12 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , a measured by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patient , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two study ) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated : anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increased relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in child .
Subcutaneous route
following subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there is no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out .
there are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indication .
16 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
if it occurs , appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU / kg given by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
17 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg given 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose is 150 IU / kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase is & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin ha increased & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
the recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
19 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / d
and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl

300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
at the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible , even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
20 The recommended dose is 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given .
care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient .
all patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only .
administer the amount required .
this medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depending on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
in case of larger volume , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
the injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously !
the intravenous route ha to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assured :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
22 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2 .
based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
in cancer patient receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
23 patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
therefore , it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysm , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agent , including patient receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have been observed ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizure , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication ( E. G. stenosis , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
25 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patient .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provided a necessary .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected .
26 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , a measured by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patient , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two study ) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated : anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increased relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in child .
Subcutaneous route
following subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there is no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out .
there are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indication .
30 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
if it occurs , appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU / kg given by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
31 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg given 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose is 150 IU / kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase is & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin ha increased & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
the recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
33 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl

300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
at the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible , even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
34 The recommended dose is 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given .
care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient .
all patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only .
administer the amount required .
this medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depending on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
in case of larger volume , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
the injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously !
the intravenous route ha to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assured :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
36 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2 .
based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
in cancer patient receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
37 patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
therefore , it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysm , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agent , including patient receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have been observed ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizure , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication ( E. G. stenosis , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
39 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patient .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provided a necessary .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected .
40 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , a measured by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patient , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two study ) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated : anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increased relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in child .
Subcutaneous route
following subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there is no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out .
there are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indication .
44 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
if it occurs , appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU / kg given by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
45 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg given 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose is 150 IU / kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase is & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin ha increased & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
the recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
47 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl

Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
at the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible , even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
48 The recommended dose is 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given .
care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient .
all patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only .
administer the amount required .
this medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depending on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
in case of larger volume , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
the injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously !
the intravenous route ha to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assured :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
50 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2 .
based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
in cancer patient receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
51 patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
therefore , it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysm , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agent , including patient receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have been observed ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizure , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication ( E. G. stenosis , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
53 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patient .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provided a necessary .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected .
54 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , a measured by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patient , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two study ) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated : anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increased relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in child .
Subcutaneous route
following subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there is no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out .
there are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indication .
58 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
if it occurs , appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU / kg given by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
59 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg given 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose is 150 IU / kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase is & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin ha increased & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
the recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
61 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl

Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
at the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible , even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
62 The recommended dose is 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given .
care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient .
all patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only .
administer the amount required .
this medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depending on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
in case of larger volume , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
the injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously !
the intravenous route ha to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assured :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
64 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2 .
based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
in cancer patient receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
65 patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
therefore , it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysm , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agent , including patient receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have been observed ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizure , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication ( E. G. stenosis , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
67 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patient .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provided a necessary .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected .
68 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , a measured by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patient , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two study ) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated : anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increased relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in child .
Subcutaneous route
following subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there is no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out .
there are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indication .
72 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
if it occurs , appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU / kg given by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
73 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg given 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose is 150 IU / kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase is & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin ha increased & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
the recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
75 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / d
and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
12 g / dl )
300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
at the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible , even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
76 The recommended dose is 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given .
care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient .
all patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only .
administer the amount required .
this medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depending on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
in case of larger volume , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
the injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously !
the intravenous route ha to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assured :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
78 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2 .
based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
in cancer patient receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
79 patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
therefore , it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysm , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agent , including patient receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have been observed ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizure , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication ( E. G. stenosis , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
81 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patient .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provided a necessary .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected .
82 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , a measured by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patient , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two study ) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated : anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increased relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in child .
Subcutaneous route
following subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there is no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out .
there are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indication .
86 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
if it occurs , appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU / kg given by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
87 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg given 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose is 150 IU / kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase is & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin ha increased & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
the recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
89 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / d
and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
12 g / dl )
300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
at the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible , even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
90 The recommended dose is 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given .
care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient .
all patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only .
administer the amount required .
this medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depending on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
in case of larger volume , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
the injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously !
the intravenous route ha to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assured :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
92 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2 .
based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
in cancer patient receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
93 patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
therefore , it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysm , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agent , including patient receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have been observed ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizure , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication ( E. G. stenosis , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
95 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patient .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provided a necessary .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected .
96 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , a measured by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patient , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two study ) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated : anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increased relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in child .
Subcutaneous route
following subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there is no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out .
there are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indication .
100 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
if it occurs , appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU / kg given by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
101 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg given 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose is 150 IU / kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase is & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin ha increased & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
the recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
103 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / d
and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
12 g / dl )
300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
at the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible , even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
104 The recommended dose is 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given .
care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient .
all patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only .
administer the amount required .
this medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depending on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
in case of larger volume , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
the injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously !
the intravenous route ha to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assured :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
106 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2 .
based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
in cancer patient receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
107 patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
therefore , it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysm , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agent , including patient receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have been observed ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizure , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication ( E. G. stenosis , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
109 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patient .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provided a necessary .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected .
110 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , a measured by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patient , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two study ) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated : anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increased relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in child .
Subcutaneous route
following subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there is no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out .
there are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indication .
114 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
if it occurs , appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU / kg given by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
115 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg given 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose is 150 IU / kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase is & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin ha increased & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
the recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
117 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl

Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
at the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible , even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
118 The recommended dose is 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given .
care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient .
all patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only .
administer the amount required .
this medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depending on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
in case of larger volume , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
the injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously !
the intravenous route ha to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assured :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
120 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2 .
based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
in cancer patient receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
121 patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
therefore , it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysm , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agent , including patient receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have been observed ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizure , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication ( E. G. stenosis , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
123 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patient .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provided a necessary .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected .
124 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , a measured by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patient , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two study ) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated : anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increased relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in child .
Subcutaneous route
following subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there is no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out .
there are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indication .
128 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
if it occurs , appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU / kg given by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
129 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg given 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment is divided into two stage :
correction phase :
starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose is 150 IU / kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase is & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin ha increased & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count ha increased & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
the recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
131 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl

Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
at the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible , even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
132 The recommended dose is 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given .
care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient .
all patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only .
administer the amount required .
this medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depending on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
in case of larger volume , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
the injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously !
the intravenous route ha to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assured :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
134 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2 .
based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
in cancer patient receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
135 patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
therefore , it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysm , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agent , including patient receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have been observed ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizure , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication ( E. G. stenosis , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
137 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patient .
patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be excluded .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provided a necessary .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected .
138 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , a measured by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patient , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two study ) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated : anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increased relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in child .
Subcutaneous route
following subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there is no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out .
there are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .
