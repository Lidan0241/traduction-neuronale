the results of the major european neighbourhood policy conference on 3 september also show that our partners and our member states are now fully in agreement with this prioritisation .
the conference was a real success , because it brought all of our ENP partners and all the member states together for the first time , along with representatives of the various authorities and of civil society .
a clear consensus emerged on the substantive priorities of the neighbourhood policy , from economic integration to greater mobility , and from energy policy to political cooperation .
parliament can play an especially prominent and important role in the realm of political cooperation , and of course you are also a catalyst for the development of democracy , for human rights and for reforms leading towards the establishment of the rule of law , to which we naturally attach the utmost importance here , and which serve as a compass of this neighbourhood policy .
the neighbourhood policy is already yielding definite results too .
one need only consider how much we have intensified our cooperation with ukraine in the ENP framework since the Orange revolution .
the fact that ukraine has now held free and fair elections for the second time undoubtedly constitutes a success .
i hope that the political decision-makers in Kiev will now maintain the momentum of recent weeks .
we shall continue to work with you on the implementation of major reforms too , with the aid of the substantial ENP action plan .
negotiations are progressing on an enhanced agreement , which , as you are aware , is intended to bring ukraine as close as possible to the european union .
we shall also continue , of course , to support ukraine &apos;s accession to the wto so that we can establish a comprehensive free-trade area , and we have already - as you know - concluded a visa-facilitation agreement with ukraine and hope that the same can be done soon with the republic of Moldova , each of these agreements being accompanied by an agreement on readmission .
Morocco is another enthusiastic beneficiary of this neighbourhood policy , and is using it astutely as an engine of modernisation , which is precisely what we wanted to happen .
we have very clearly commended Morocco &apos;s progress on the basis of its detailed internal reform programme , and the new aviation agreement and Morocco &apos;s close energy cooperation with the eu , for example , are good models of fruitful cooperation .
only last week i was in Rabat for talks , at which i also initiated further progress on the joint reflection process we began in july with a view to meeting Morocco &apos;s request for advanced status in the ENP framework .
i am confident that in the second half of next year we shall be able to present appropriate proposals on a new and advanced form of association .
the neighbourhood policy , then , is working , but we must go further , of course , in our efforts to make it even better , even more effective and even more comprehensive .
last december the commission published recommendations on ways of strengthening the ENP , which our president-in-office of the council has already presented .
i believe we have taken some very important steps .
for example , our eastern partners lacked a regional dimension , but now we have launched this black sea synergy programme as a tailor-made process for the east .
it gives the east what the south has long possessed in the form of the euro-mediterranean partnership , and the first meeting in the black sea synergy framework will take place in 2008 .
we have also made progress towards opening community programmes and agencies to our neighbours .
this year we shall also be awarding the first allocations from the new governance facility , through which we are demonstrating that we can and will offer more to those partners that display genuine reforming zeal .
in addition , before the year is out we shall have established the neighbourhood investment facility .
its purpose is to help mobilise funds for the neighbourhood policy over and above our normal budget , primarily to make it possible to fund the large-scale projects in areas such as energy and transport .
i do believe we can claim some successes , but we now need your continued support and that of the member states to enable us to make further improvements and take further steps .
i am thinking mainly of closer economic integration and of more intensive free trade with our partners .
their integration into the eu internal market is , of course , a very powerful reform lever .
for this reason we must also gradually open our market , even to what we call sensitive agricultural goods and services , in which our partners have certain competitive advantages .
this means that we must also ask ourselves whether we are prepared to do that .
the second thing i am thinking of is further visa-facilitation measures , which are urgently required to facilitate contacts between people in different countries .
these measures can often be taken within the existing rules , provided there is enough political will to use the available scope , and we must continue to develop the political dimension of the neighbourhood policy .
this relates to the frozen conflicts we see in the partner countries on our eastern borders , conflicts that seriously impede our neighbours &apos; progress towards reform and , in some cases , threaten our own security .
for this reason the neighbourhood policy must help to create the right climate for the resolution of conflicts such as the one in the southern caucasus .
in the mediterranean region , i shall naturally continue to press for progress in the middle east , especially in the Quartet framework , and i very much hope that the meeting in Annapolis and the subsequent donors &apos; conference in paris will materialise so that further genuine progress can be made in the middle east .
we are also prepared to help the parties to the conflict in the western Sahara in their quest for a long-term solution .
in the coming period our neighbourhood policy will be sharply focused on practical implementation .
we must all pull together in order to maintain and intensify the dynamics of reform that have developed among our partners .
next month the commission will adopt another communication on the neighbourhood policy , in which we shall outline the steps which the eu needs to take in order to deliver further tangible results in 2008 , in other words our own contribution .
in april we shall then present the country-by-country progress reports , in which we shall analyse where our neighbours can further improve the implementation of the action plans .
at the beginning of december some fundamental questions will have to be asked , such as whether the commission is fully aware of the various capacities and goals of individual neighbouring countries .
as i have said , however , we can make a good deal of progress on the basis of this differentiated approach .
it seems to me that importance also attaches to the concept of ownership and the local potential for putting the ownership principle into practice , as well as to even greater involvement of civil society , an area in which we could still do far more .
i must not omit to add a few words on the events in Georgia , which we have been discussing together .
i merely want to add that we are very concerned about the latest developments in Georgia .
we regret the excessive use of force on the part of the Georgian state security forces in breaking up demonstrations and closing down independent television stations .
i believe we need an independent inquiry into these incidents .
we also remain concerned about the continuing state of emergency and the restrictions on the freedom of the media , for curtailing constitutional rights and closing down media operators are draconian measures which are inconsistent with those democratic values that underlie our bilateral relations with Georgia and that Georgia has pledged itself to uphold .
we therefore expect these measures to be lifted without delay .
i welcome , on the other hand , the decision taken by president Saakashvili to hold presidential elections and a referendum on the date for parliamentary elections , thereby meeting the main demands of the opposition .
i hope this will help to ease tension , and i appeal to all involved to keep political disputes within the bounds of the normal democratic process and to return from the streets to the negotiating table .
we need the right conditions for a fair and transparent electoral process .
i just wanted to add that .
do forgive me for taking longer than usual , but since i bear particular responsibility on the basis of the precept that politics is about people , you will understand that these matters are particularly close to my heart .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on regional development . - mr president , the committee on regional development views a strengthened european neighbourhood policy as a key tool first and foremost to bring our neighbours closer to the european system of values .
an efficient and open ENP can provide multiple incentives for boosting economic , legal and social reforms in countries bordering the eu .
true , the ENP is not to be seen as a direct route to eu membership .
therefore , the conditionality principle in the eu approach should provide workable mechanisms to encourage necessarily economic and democratic changes in our partner countries , in accordance with their own willingness and progress .
the ENP can only function as a two-way street .
on a political level , i think the ENP would provide us with a wonderful opportunity to deepen regular political dialogue with countries which are willing to align their foreign policy positions with those of the eu , countries like ukraine , Moldova , Georgia , Armenia and others .
the committee on regional development stresses the crucial importance of cross-border and interregional cooperation programmes in implementing the ENP .
these programmes should include economic and environmental as well as social and cultural aspects .
i would like to stress another principle : ENP should not be limited to cooperation between governments and institutions .
it has to involve civil society and especially stimulate grass-root exchanges between citizens , ngos and local authorities .
therefore , it is important to facilitate efficiently visa requirements for local border traffic and for specific population groups .
we also call on the commission to develop guidelines for local and regional authorities on their specific role in implementing the ENP action plans to develop the ENP further .
finally , in the regional development committee &apos;s opinion , the ENP should also include cooperation in preventing and dealing jointly with natural disasters .
we encourage the member states to include this aspect in the cross-border cooperation programmes .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs . - mr president , in these times of globalisation and insecurity about the future , our neighbours need clear signs from the european union .
they need to hear that we consider them as partners .
they need to know that we support them in their transition towards democracy and a better life .
therefore i welcome the commission proposal for strengthening the ENP by offering our partners new incentives for reforms .
as draftsman of the opinion for the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs , i want to insist on the importance of the ENP as a means of enforcing an area of freedom , security and justice that goes beyond our borders .
we cannot afford to leave our neighbours dealing alone with security issues , organised crime and illegal migration .
in today &apos;s world , each of these phenomena has a global impact and these challenges are our challenges .
the ENP is ultimately a win-win policy .
building an area of freedom , security and justice is in our mutual interest for the eu and for our neighbours , for the sake of all our people .
i am being told that the presidency of the council had not been informed that the debate was a joint debate on the european neighbourhood policy and the situation in Georgia .
we shall therefore give mr Lobo Antunes the opportunity to deal with the latter topic now , with the change of speaker .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) i really did not understand why this debate should cover both neighbourhood policy and Georgia .
we do not have much time , which is why i would like to say very quickly that on 18 november last , as you know , the presidency issued a declaration expressing its deep concern at recent events in Georgia , and called for dialogue between the parties and a search for solutions to the current crisis that did not violate democratic principles and fundamental rights , namely freedom of expression .
we would also like to stress that it is essential for the government of Georgia to restore confidence in the legitimacy of its actions and to do its utmost to ensure respect for the principles of democracy .
from our point of view the current situation remains a cause for concern , but we very much welcome the Georgian parliament &apos;s announcement that the state of emergency will be lifted on 16 november next , the day after tomorrow .
we hope that this will actually come to fruition rather than simply remaining an announcement .
this is an important step towards restoring democratic normality in Georgia , since presidential elections have been announced for the near future and all the democratic conditions necessary for those elections to take place must naturally be guaranteed .
we are also pleased that dialogue has been established between the authorities and the opposition .
i can inform you that the council is working with Georgia in exerting political and diplomatic pressure to ensure a rapid return to normality .
our special representative for the region is active and is currently in Georgia .
i can also inform you that the situation in Georgia will be on the agenda of the next general affairs and external relations council .
some three weeks ago i personally chaired an association council between the european union and Georgia , when i was able to highlight the economic progress the country was making and to refer with some hope to the democratic developments that we considered to be positive .
we sincerely hope that what is currently happening in Georgia is not a backward step , since that would naturally be highly detrimental to the positive aspects of the development of both the political and the economic situation that we thought were encouraging .
i assume that the Georgian people and the Georgian authorities are aware of that .
a backward step is neither possible nor acceptable .
on behalf of the ppe-de group . - ( PL ) mr president , commissioner , minister , i would like to refer to one aspect of the excellent report prepared by our colleagues mr Tannock and mr Raimon Obiols i Germà .
this is the idea of the EURO-NEST parliamentary assembly .
the main purpose of EURO-NEST , as proposed in the report , is to put into practice the idea of creating a circle of friends of the eu on the parliamentary level and making them friends among themselves .
this is to supplement the policy of neighbourliness pursued by the executive bodies of the eu .
EURO-NEST would be a parliamentary forum for dialogue , the exchange of experiences and multilateral cooperation .
it is not just a matter of strengthening contacts between the european parliament and the national parliaments of ukraine , Moldova , Azerbaijan , Armenia and Georgia , as well as with representatives of democratic forces in Belarus .
for us , the most important issue is that our neighbours should have dialogue and cooperation among themselves , that they should get to know each other better , develop trust in each other and benefit from the best examples of democracy , free speech and respect for human rights .
the concept of EURO-NEST was supported by the majority of the members of the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
i would hope that it will also gain the support of all of parliament .
i would like to address my colleagues from the liberal group , who submitted amendment number 5 , which proposed replacing EURO-NEST with the existing organisation PABSEC .
i would like to say that PABSEC , the parliamentary association on black sea economic cooperation , fulfils a completely different function .
first and foremost there is no role within that organisation for the european parliament .
thank you to my colleagues from the socialist group for their understanding .
the compromise formula , replacing amendment number 11 and emphasising the need for better intergovernmental cooperation , will make it possible to delineate this form of cooperation in the proper way .
i am convinced that EURO-NEST will provide an additional impetus to strengthening partnership with our eastern neighbours and will complement relations with regard to our southern neighbours as part of the barcelona process .
it will be a signal that , in the european parliament , we treat our neighbours seriously , and proof that we are strengthening ties with our eastern neighbours , irrespective of party divisions .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( PL ) mr president , in the report under consideration there are some important statements and they come at a good time .
the situation in the countries to which the report relates ( i am speaking mostly about the eastern area ) is a very dynamic one , bringing , as can be expected , many new experiences .
it is very good that european institutions - the commission , the council and the european parliament - are speaking with a common voice , a voice that reflects the function for which the institutions were created , and for these introductory statements i would like to thank the commissioner and the minister .
i would also like to thank the rapporteurs .
the socialist group in the european parliament supports the development of a european neighbourhood policy , a strengthened european neighbourhood policy , provided that it is prudent and effective .
during work on this report we avoided many unnecessary disputes .
we avoided a rather unwise discussion on whether neighbourliness with the east is more important , or neighbourliness with the south .
that would be like asking a child &apos; who do you love more , your Mummy or your Daddy ? &apos;
we avoided any unnecessary debate on whether or not a european neighbourhood policy takes the place of a policy aimed at eu enlargement .
these , too , are unreal dilemmas , but these matters received clarification .
a european neighbourhood policy can be effective if it is carried out jointly .
&apos;Jointly &apos; means that it is carried out by the european union as well as by interested countries .
it cannot be the same towards all countries , because these countries have different degrees of democracy and are interested in implementing this policy in different ways .
how delicate a matter this is you have seen for yourselves , in observing what took place recently in Georgia , which has just been the subject of discussion .
satisfaction because of another democratic election in ukraine has been clouded by the fact that these were the second elections in two years in that country .
one could say a mixed satisfaction .
as far as the east is concerned , our policy relates to an area that is constantly troubled by intrigue organised by the russian federation , whether this is obvious or hidden .
finally , as the minister said , this policy can only be successful if it is accompanied by resources , political will , effective action and an absence of naivety , especially if the creation of new institutions is involved .
on behalf of the ALDE group . - ( FI ) mr president , neighbourhood policy is one of the priorities of the eu &apos;s foreign policy .
the european neighbourhood policy is part of a wider aim to promote peace , stability and economic prosperity .
the implementation of the ENP also demands much from the eu , as the strategic goals of the 27 member states have to be able to be compatible .
it is important to avoid east-west confrontation , although , obviously , the member states of the eu have different priorities when it comes to cooperation .
cooperation is needed in all directions .
as all the eu member states are involved as well as 16 partner countries , it is also understandable that people should have strong misgivings in the development of this policy as to how the different partner countries can be included in the collaboration .
the ENP policy &apos;s strength , however , lies in the fact that it provides the eu with more resources to aid the partner countries than would be the case if each country were approached separately and from totally different angles .
the ENP &apos;s comprehensive approach also ensures that eu policy does not depend on the regional and national predilections of each country to hold the presidency .
my group offers its unambiguous support for the development of the ENP and the priority areas highlighted by the commission , which are economic integration , the mobility of people , energy ( to which we would definitely like to add climate change ) , and financial and technical assistance .
( applause )
on behalf of the uen group . - ( PL ) mr president , the european neighbourhood policy gained more impetus at the same time as the last enlargement of the eu .
it now helps to encourage neighbouring regions to move towards the european value system .
it is the sine qua non for realising objectives that are in both sides &apos; interests , that is , a guarantee of security and stability and the promotion of values such as respect for human rights and full democracy .
at the same time , within the framework of the european neighbourhood policy it is worth emphasising the particular significance and identity of countries such as , for example , ukraine .
this country should have a special status within the group of countries included in the ENP and should be given priority treatment , first and foremost because of its role in europe &apos;s cultural heritage and its historical ties with neighbouring countries .
granting ukraine privileged status is also particularly important because this country has a pivotal role to play in ensuring energy stability and security for the whole european union .
the issue of ukraine and opening the way for its full membership of the eu should therefore be considered on an individual basis , taking into consideration that it is ukraine that is the eu &apos;s principal partner in the east european neighbourhood .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE group . - ( fr ) mr president , i should like to say , firstly , that i am sorry this is a joint debate because the crisis in Georgia ought to have been the subject of a debate in its own right .
last weekend , the president of this house sent me to Georgia .
i have just returned and i should have liked to deliver a report on events there and the various meetings i had .
two minutes - sadly - will not be long enough for me to do that .
before talking about Georgia , however , i should like to welcome the latest arrival among the european neighbourhood policy countries , namely Mauritania - a country which i recently visited as head of our election observation mission there .
what is clear today is that the serious crisis in Georgia has certainly put our european neighbourhood policy to the test .
can this neighbourhood policy be really useful ?
it is now legitimate to ask that question in the light of the situation in Georgia .
what i can tell you , colleagues , is that , four years on from the non-violent rose revolution , the communities in Georgia are truly shocked by the violence of which we saw something on our television screens : the violence directed against Georgia &apos;s people and the violence used to close down Imedi tv .
they are shocked because they do not understand what is going on .
i am therefore grateful to the commission for calling on the Georgian authorities to instigate an inquiry - an independent and transparent investigation - because people want to know exactly what happened and how it happened .
we visited the country and , of course , we heard two versions of events : the opposition version and the authorities &apos; version .
both are admissible .
it is very clear that two versions exist , but people are calling for genuine transparency .
obviously we must remember not only , as our colleague reminded us , that Georgia is vulnerable - and we do know that - but also that Georgia has to compromise with a &apos; big brother &apos; constantly lying in wait to catch it out .
when the Georgian authorities draw our attention to russia &apos;s omnipresence , we need to consider the sort of things that happen .
we had an example with our visa facilitation arrangement with russia , benefiting people from Abkhazia and south Ossetia who hold russian passports , even though these areas are part of Georgian territory , and thus placing Georgia in an awkward position .
none of this is news to you , commissioner .
what we must demand today - in addition , obviously , to lifting of the state of emergency - is the immediate restoration of freedom of expression and media freedom and of course , most importantly , an assurance that there will be free and transparent elections .
Georgia today is capable of organising such elections .
it demonstrated that just last year when it held transparent , democratic local elections in full accordance with international standards .
it is now time - and i am addressing the council here , for i believe it has been somewhat harsh with the Georgian authorities - for us , with our european neighbourhood policy , to demonstrate that we can be useful .
we need to show the people of Georgia that there is some point to the ENP .
the european union must not let them down .
that is the message we should convey very strongly to the Georgian authorities .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( es ) mr president , commissioner , minister , first i would like to thank mr Tannock and mr Obiols for presenting the report and , without further ado , to inform you that my group is critical of the evolution and approach taken in the neighbourhood policy .
there are two clear examples towards the west and the south , namely the conflict in the Sahara , to which mrs Ferrero-Waldner has referred , and the conflict with israel or , to put it another way , the responsibility of Morocco and the state of israel for two conflicts : the occupied territories of the western Sahara and the palestinian conflict .
i sincerely believe that in those areas the neighbourhood policy would have to be much more demanding of those two states in order for them to assume responsibility once and for all for conflicts which in the one case has been going on for almost a hundred years , and in the other has been in existence for forty or fifty years without having been resolved .
we therefore believe that from that point of view we would have liked the european union to take a much more rigorous position when establishing the neighbourhood policy .
on behalf of the IND / DEM group . - mr president , this report clearly demonstrates how the Europhile political elite in this place are completely out of touch with reality and the wishes of their constituents .
the report asks for the processing of visas to be urgently improved so that travel from some non-eu states can be made easier and less burdensome .
this is not what most Londoners want .
they do not want to make it easier for people to come to britain : they want to make it harder .
they want to be more selective of the people we invite to our country , not to extend the current open-door policy .
the report anticipates Ukrainian entry to the eu .
ukraine has a population of 46 million and , as eu citizens , they would all have the right to enter britain .
the majority of my constituents do not want millions more people given the right of entry to britain .
they do not want any more indiscriminate immigration from eastern europe .
we already have enough immigrants driving around london without tax and insurance ; we have enough criminals , drug dealers , fraudsters , people traffickers and sex slaves .
another crackpot idea in this report is the call for a eu neighbourhood parliamentary assembly - another talking shop of politicians , out of touch with reality , dreaming up more ways of wasting taxpayers &apos; money .
these politicians would , of course , need to be handsomely rewarded for their efforts .
it should surprise no one that one of the authors of this report is a member of the british conservative party , a party that pretends to be eurosceptic at home , but is enthusiastically Europhile here .
no wonder that in london mr Tannock is known as the member for eastern europe .
i totally oppose these policies ; they damage the interests of my constituents .
that is why i will be re-elected in london in 2009 , and mr Tannock may not be .
mr president , recital c of the report says that the european neighbourhood policy &apos; should remain distinct from the process of enlargement , whereas participation in the ENP does not preclude , for the eastern neighbours which are clearly identifiable as european countries , any perspective of eu membership in the long term &apos; .
for some reason that rule seems not to apply to turkey .
here we have precisely the opposite situation .
turkey is clearly identifiable as a non-European country , is not part of the european neighbourhood policy , but it does aspire to membership of the eu .
it has never really been clear why turkey was not included in the ENP .
the commission said at the outset that as an applicant country turkey &apos;s inclusion was not appropriate .
that is odd , because in other cases the point is specifically made that the neighbourhood policy and the enlargement process must remain distinct from one another .
for turkey clearly a sui generis rule applies .
all this , i fear , has to do with ideological obfuscation .
even assuming total commitment to negotiations on turkish accession , we ought to have included turkey in the european neighbourhood policy , if only for reasons of prudence .
if the negotiations had to be suspended , as they should have been long ago , turkey could then have been absorbed directly into an existing structure .
it did not happen , and things will only be more difficult as a result in future .
( PL ) mr president , after today &apos;s vote i found out - perhaps it was only i who found this out - that the identity , tradition and sovereignty group ceased to exist at the time that the president of the parliament announced this information .
however , i note that , according to the list of debates , this group does still exist , so i am not at all sure who made the mistake : was it mr McMillan-Scott when he announced that the group had ceased to exist , or the person who writes these lists ?
mr Siwiec , the electronic mechanism has still not been updated , but mr Claeys has not already spoken on behalf of a group which ceased to exist a couple of hours ago , rather he spoke as a Non-Attached member .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , i am indeed astonished at the words of mr Batten , who comes from the cosmopolitan united kingdom and yet is spreading narrow-minded and xenophobic propaganda here with his false allegations .
that has nothing to do with the proud tradition of his great country .
the neighbourhood policy has surely become the european union &apos;s main instrument of foreign policy now that we are entering more of a consolidation phase following the accession of twelve countries altogether .
for this reason it is important that the instrument of the ENP is used in an appropriate and concentrated manner , and indeed this is clearly being done in some respects .
the neighbourhood policy also gives us a solid instrument for active involvement in matters relating to the conflict in the middle east , as commissioner Ferrero-Waldner indicated .
i do believe the emergence of solutions in Georgia so soon after the outbreaks of tension , and the fact that fresh elections are to be held , are partly connected with the effects of the european perspective and the neighbourhood policy , and show that we are on the right track here .
the policy gives us the means to look after our interests , to forge links , to serve the interests of our partners and to foster the development of human rights and democracy .
when we discuss Belarus in this context , commissioner , i find it interesting how we are managing to find a suitable way to link the instruments for human rights and democracy in a situation in which the neighbourhood instrument cannot yet have the same impact .
that is an important exercise , which we must repeat in the coming year .
we have here an eastern neighbourhood policy and a southern neighbourhood policy .
both are equally important , but the method need not always be the same , because the eastern neighbourhood policy also has this dimension of the european perspective , which means that there can be different starting points and , to a certain extent , different prospects too .
a policy that has to do with association agreements , with partnership and cooperation agreements and with the objectives of getting a country such as ukraine into the wto and then creating a free-trade area - with steps towards that kind of development - seems to me to be a very important instrument of progress .
this is a policy of joint responsibility .
it is not a matter of the central european member states alone looking eastward and the southern europeans looking southward ; the whole european community is responsible for both parts .
for this reason , i have to say that i cannot accept proposals such as that for a mediterranean union .
i would very much like to see people in spain and france concerning themselves with ukraine , and Swedes and Germans taking the same interest in Morocco .
that , and not a new division of the european union , must be our policy .
( applause )
( NL ) mr president , first may i wholeheartedly , on behalf of my group , echo the appeal which elmar brok addressed to us all just now .
it shows how important the neighbourhood policy is to the european union &apos;s external activities .
we welcome the plans to strengthen the ENP , but this does not mean that the ENP is the finished article .
the eu must keep looking for ways of making the policy more effective .
differentiation - as others have said too - is the key to making the neighbourhood policy a success .
the ENP applies to a huge area , from Morocco to ukraine .
europe &apos;s influence is not the same in all these countries , and europe is not equally attractive to all of them .
within the context of the ENP , the eu must offer its partner countries the cooperation agreement that best meets its expectations .
this is a given which we think should be reflected in the commission &apos;s priorities .
Georgia &apos;s european aspirations are different from those of Azerbaijan .
Tunisia is less important to the eu than ukraine and lebanon does not have the same weight as Morocco .
hence the need to consider each country individually .
we must concentrate on those countries where the ENP &apos;s key objective of bringing neighbouring countries closer to europe appears the most achievable .
the report also talks about the ENP countries &apos; eastern neighbours .
we think it is a good idea , as part of the recently adopted central asia strategy , to work for solid ties with the countries in question .
in so doing , the european union could certainly draw on experience from its neighbourhood policy .
we do not , however , endorse the idea of giving countries outside the region the status of ENP countries .
we would do better to focus on a coherent approach to central asia rather than dragging certain countries into the ENP .
lastly , stronger parliamentary cooperation with the ENP countries to the east is only useful if it is accompanied by multilateral cooperation by the region &apos;s governments .
if a parliamentary assembly were to be set up , there would also have to be a ministerial assembly , as in other regions where we have created parliamentary assemblies of this kind .
in our view there could only be a parliament of this kind if the council and commission also created an intergovernmental counterpart .
( fr ) mr president , as rapporteur on the south caucasus , i should like to use the opportunity of this report by mr Tannock and mr Obiols i Germà - whom i congratulate , by the way , on their work - to tell you my impressions of the situation in Georgia , based on a visit i made there on 5 november , at the height of the demonstrations .
i found it a very complex situation .
the major reforms that had been undertaken were , on the one hand , impressive , particularly in relation to the economy and to combating corruption ; on the other hand , the difficult social climate has to be borne in mind , with very high unemployment and a third of the population living below the poverty line .
the most striking thing is the very tense , indeed aggressive , political climate , with the opposition levelling extremely grave accusations at the president , then engaging in public retractions that simply raise more questions .
the government responds with repeated accusations of foreign - i.e. russian - interference , and produces video footage in support of its claims .
the events of 7 november - the declaration of the state of emergency , the violent police crackdown on demonstrators and the closure of the television station - underscored the extremely worrying nature of the situation .
obviously actions like this do not sit well in the traditional european framework of values rooted in the rule of law and fundamental rights ; and they need to be explained .
we must hope that the presidential election scheduled for 5 january will allow democratic debate to return to the fore .
it will be up to the Georgian people to decide what is rumour and what is fact , and whether to focus on their disappointments or on the challenges ahead .
it will be up to us , however , to encourage them and to assist in the organisation of genuinely democratic , properly conducted elections , in accordance with international standards .
the issue at stake is the credibility and stability of democracy in Georgia .
( LV ) ladies and gentlemen , after the rose revolution , Georgia demonstrated its wish to subscribe to european values .
it expected our understanding and sensitivity .
unfortunately , we have totally ignored this wish .
last year i called for cis peace-keeping forces to be replaced by international peace-keepers .
i suggested a review of the legality of issuing russian passports in Abkhazia and south Ossetia , which alters the national make-up of Georgian citizens .
i proposed that the commission and the council should adopt the same visa facilitation for Georgia that is currently granted in russia .
however , these calls for more active involvement in resolving Georgia &apos;s problems fell on deaf ears .
this disregard has done much to encourage the current situation .
the path of democratisation and reform often means internal political crises , especially in this situation , where they are provided by a large neighbouring state .
the european union must listen to Georgia and must demonstrate its solidarity through deeds as well as words .
thank you .
( de ) mr president , the official aim of the european neighbourhood policy is to create , and i quote , &apos; a ring of stable , friendly states &apos; around the eu .
a very large amount of money is being spent on it - eur 12 billion for the period from 2007 to 2013 .
for what purposes ?
there has been much talk of human rights , but it is all about asserting the interests of the eu .
for example , there is talk of establishing a free-trade area .
for whose benefit , i ask .
there is a lot about protecting borders and controlling migration .
these are things that we do not support , and so , as my colleague willy Meyer-Pleite has said , our group will not be voting for the report .
( NL ) mr president , the commission &apos;s commitment to the state of israel under the european neighbourhood policy is a matter close to my heart .
only yesterday the commission demonstrated it here in the person of its eminent spokesman Dr Andreas Eldina .
keep it up , commissioner .
i know i have the backing of our co-rapporteur , mr Tannock , and of the chairwoman of our israel delegation , mrs Hybášková .
i have one burning question to ask .
what specific new possibilities does the commissioner envisage for strengthening the european neighbourhood policy in regard to israel , certainly in view of the highly developed political and economic status of the jewish state ?
in short , is it not altogether appropriate to differentiate here within the european neighbourhood policy ?
i think it is .
indeed !
( es ) mr president , it is very important for our neighbours to be a circle of prosperous , stable , peaceful countries where power is based on democratic models and where there is full respect for basic rights .
this idea must be a basic premise for the european neighbourhood policy , a policy which should encourage and help our neighbours to undertake the reforms necessary to make the values i referred to above effective .
the issue of political , economic and social reforms is , for me , an essential part of the report which we will approve tomorrow .
a second thought is that the neighbourhood policy must have regard to each country &apos;s specific characteristics .
differences must not be drawn on the basis of the continent to which the country belongs .
neighbours are just that : neighbours .
that is the important point .
the fact that some of them are also european may have consequences in terms of potential accession to the union , but not for the purposes of neighbourhood policy .
that is a more general assertion with which i agree , because it would be a mistake for us to discriminate against one group of countries in favour of another .
there cannot be a first-tier neighbourhood policy and another , second-tier , neighbourhood policy .
neighbours on the southern shore of the mediterranean have noted with some apprehension that the enlargement to twenty-seven may lead to a degree of exclusion by the enlarged union ; a neighbourhood policy which prioritises eastern europe or the caucasus may well fuel that fear .
the southern mediterranean countries have very ancient links to the union .
they are crucial to us in key fields such as security , immigration and energy .
many of our member states have , as we know , extremely close historic , political , human , cultural and economic links with them .
this , then , is the second major point in my speech .
we should not differentiate between europeans and non-Europeans in the neighbourhood policy .
the policy must , as mr brok has just said , be one of shared responsibility .
in view of the above , mr president , i do not share the doubts expressed in numbered paragraph two of the report about the meaningfulness of the ENP &apos;s geographic scope .
moreover , i would not have split the report into two sections , one on european neighbours and the other on mediterranean neighbours .
a single document would have been better .
to close , my congratulations to mr Tannock and mr Obiols .
( de ) mr president , the question is whether developments in Georgia show that the neighbourhood policy has failed .
i believe that is not the case .
they show that there may still be a need to raise the profile of the neighbourhood policy , for much of what has happened there was foreseeable .
the fact is that the successes and the credit side of the rose revolution in Georgia have been tarnished in recent months and years by a good few authoritarian decisions which have encroached on the powers of the judiciary .
compounded by the social situation , this has resulted in the recent unrest , and i hope we are now strong enough to ensure , together with president Saakashvili , that a dialogue is initiated and that transparent and free elections are conducted with genuine freedom of expression , resulting in truly democratic choices .
a second reason why the neighbourhood policy needs to be strengthened is undoubtedly this whole discussion regarding further enlargement .
our intention is now to discuss enlargement to the south-east , to negotiate with the countries of south-eastern europe and turkey and to bring the process to a conclusion .
this is not the time to anticipate subsequent rounds of enlargement , but rather to strengthen relations with our neighbours , and some of those neighbouring countries , in so far as they are situated in europe , will have the chance to join the european union at a later date , though some will not .
this strong link , however , must exist .
the third reason has already been mentioned .
it is legitimate to envisage an EU-Black sea community and an EU-Mediterranean community , but it will always be the task of the european union as a whole to maintain and strengthen relations with these neighbours , a task which also involves supporting the efforts of the commission .
( HU ) mr president , the union &apos;s objective is to create an area of prosperity , stability and security with its neighbours .
there have already been some serious and solid results in this area , but there have been serious failures too .
there has not been any real progress in the area of frozen conflicts , and we do not see any ideas for solving the Transnistrian , Abkhazian , palestinian or western Saharan crises .
the countries of the neighbourhood policy do not constitute a whole , either geographically , culturally , economically or politically .
this is why a differentiated , country-specific approach is needed - it is not certain that what is good for jordan will be good for ukraine .
political and budgetary balance needs to be created as soon as possible between the eastern and southern dimensions of the neighbourhood policy .
however , this must lead to reinforcement of the eastern dimension , since it is an obvious consequence of the fact that the european union was recently enlarged , with the accession of new member states .
we have had many promises from the commission about this , but we are waiting for the commission to keep them .
thank you .
( PL ) mr president , for the european neighbourhood policy to be effective , it must be constantly monitored and adapted to the geopolitical situation .
only in this way will it be able effectively to implement the tasks required of it by the eu .
the european neighbourhood policy still faces considerable challenges .
these challenges consist not only in providing effective assistance for the creation of interstate or economic cooperation .
today it is also of vital importance to have an answer to the question of how we can help to remedy the situation in those countries where freedom is under threat .
i am thinking particularly of russia and Belarus .
the european neighbourhood policy must be a tool to exert influence on the authorities of those countries where political freedom and democracy are no more than a show , where journalists from independent media lose their lives in unexplained circumstances , and where opposition is systematically and often brutally removed from public life .
countries that act in this way must be made aware that such practices will be exposed and roundly condemned by the european union .
( HU ) thank you , mr president .
the last three years have proved that the european neighbourhood policy is a very important instrument for ever closer cooperation with the states concerned and for increasing the stability and security of our community .
the neighbourhood policy also puts us under an obligation , mainly if the fragile system constructed up to now in one of the countries concerned is at risk .
i would like to draw your attention to the situation in Georgia , where the democracy , constitutionality and vigorous economic development that have been built jointly are threatened .
the mass demonstrations and riots have made the situation uncertain .
i am convinced that the subversive intentions of russian superpower policy lie behind the situation that has developed .
the greatest attention must be paid to strengthening the system of democratic institutions .
after the declaration of a state of emergency , or excessive action by the armed forces against demonstrators , bringing the presidential elections forward was the right step in this direction .
Georgia , led by Saakashvili , is a committed partner to the eu , and despite numerous problems it is showing significant progress in the areas of reform and economic growth .
the eu , that is , the commission , the council and parliament , in cooperation with the osce , have taken an interest in resolving this tension using peaceful means .
we must give all our support to this .
the eu is a &apos; soft power &apos; , in other words the method of persuasion through involvement was proved by the Georgian situation , when president Saakashvili drove the intensified process back into the pool of democracy .
i feel it is particularly important to have a systematic review of the effectiveness of the neighbourhood policy in the mirror of the Georgian events .
Georgian power is being put to the test .
in any event , dialogue with the divided opposition , which cannot be excluded from this process , is inevitable .
despite our support , Tbilisi must prove how strong the country &apos;s democratic system is in the january elections .
today the caucasus is the front line of the new cold war , the localised cold war .
upon arrival in Tbilisi , one is greeted by a huge image of president bush and , upon arrival at the border with Ossetia , by a huge image of president Putin , symbolising the new confrontation which we thought we had overcome .
what has happened has happened , but it is now our responsibility to use the neighbourhood policy to help ensure that the elections in january are free and fair .
it will be difficult .
but such are the facts of the matter .
we , the european parliament , must be heavily involved and must participate in overseeing the elections with the osce through the observers we must send , because the area concerned is the one where most progress towards democracy is at stake in one of the most conflict-torn areas in our neighbourhood .
( FI ) mr president , i too want to thank the authors of this report for the excellent job they have done .
i would like to point out how important the role is of local and regional authorities and civil society in the implementation of the european neighbourhood policy .
when we want to promote european values in the neighbouring countries , of crucial importance are cultural and student exchanges and successful practical projects jointly realised .
the committee on regional development is also reminded of the excellent experiences of the partnership principle in cohesion policy .
these should also be used to advantage when the ENP is being implemented .
a genuine sense of rapprochement will also be achieved if the impediments regarding border traffic are relaxed and the movement of students , researchers , artists , journalists , entrepreneurs and others is facilitated .
( PL ) mr president , in speaking of the european neighbourhood policy we must remember , first of all , to support those governments that respect basic freedoms and human rights , and to encourage those rights in countries where they are not respected .
this is of fundamental importance for the stability of the european continent .
the list of countries included in the ENP is a long one .
i would like to draw your attention to two countries , ukraine and Belarus , which may be included in the ENP .
ukraine must be a priority for us , and current negotiations with that country should lead to the conclusion of an association agreement and then make it possible for that country to become a member of the eu .
such a policy should provide us with an insurance policy against russia &apos;s developing ambitions and yet another attempt to make ukraine a vassal state .
finally , Belarus - the commission &apos;s initiative to invite Belarus as an observer to the ENP conference would seem to be premature .
we should bear in mind that this country is still under the dictatorship of Lukashenko , breaching human rights and the rights of ethnic minorities .
the eu would do better to provide more effective support for the people and the opposition within Belarus .
a reduction in the cost of visas for Belarussians , and particularly for students , could be a positive signal in this direction , and the commission should introduce this without delay .
mr president , i should like first of all to congratulate the commission on having collaborated on such a unique concept as the ENP .
now finally we have a clear distinction between the enlargement instrument and the ENP .
europe is in a very peaceful process .
so far it is extremely successful .
the ENP represents a necessary amount of creative thinking which will guard and protect peace and stability for our kids .
energy security , immigration and counter-terrorism are all core issues .
the more clear , precise and analytical and the less political that we are , the better we are equipped to face these threats .
allow me , then , to use this particular context and to ask about the legal basis .
some action plans will expire soon .
specifically i point to the EU-Israel action plan , which is due to expire in april 2008 .
the german presidency created the reflection group .
its main task is to come up with clear working action for the future .
in between , madam commissioner , your work , our work , is very positively reflected in israel itself .
the council and commission received a non-paper reflecting on the simple fact that israel wishes to enhance our bilateral relations , to have the eu and israel meeting annually , to have regular high-level cooperation .
madam commissioner , my question is how the commission will reflect on the israeli non-paper and especially how will the commission work on a new action plan ?
how will our new action plan or enhanced action plan reflect our concerns - counter-terrorism , the fight against extremism , xenophobia , energy security and of course human rights issues , as well as international issues , the geneva conventions ?
how will all this be reflected and how we will answer the reflection group and the german presidency ?
mr president , i am also very concerned about the crisis in Georgia and i have to admit that i am negatively surprised .
recent developments are very unfortunate and regrettable for all those who are in favour of the democratic development of Georgia .
the reports of organisations such as Amnesty international and human rights watch and the Georgian ombudsman &apos;s report are very disturbing .
given the situation in the country at present , i welcome the statement by the speaker of the Georgian parliament that the state of emergency will be lifted on friday and that within two days from today normal life will hopefully return to the Georgian citizens .
the situation , in my opinion , undermines the reputation of the government and also of mr Saakashvili , who rose to power with peaceful protests in 2003 , and that cast him as the most democratic leader in the caucasus .
the fact that president Saakashvili has already called presidential elections on 5 january 2008 is a positive step that has already helped to ease the tensions in the country .
but the government has to hold a democratic and free election in accordance with international standards in order to show to the world that the country is moving on .
therefore the government must guarantee that the election campaign will ensure freedom of expression to all the candidates .
i welcome the dialogue which is taking place between the authorities and the opposition ; it is a progressive sign .
i also expect and call upon all the parties involved to act with responsibility during the whole electoral campaign and to engage constructively in the challenge , which is free and safe democratic elections .
( PL ) mr president , it is vitally important that , in tandem with the neighbourhood policy , the doors of the european union should remain open to our east european neighbours .
membership can be a long-term possibility , as it is dependent on the progress of reforms and on compliance with the copenhagen criteria , but it has great symbolic and political significance .
i know , based on the example of my own country , that the possibility of eu membership alone has the power to mobilise society to take the path of economic reforms and democratic change .
today , in the european parliament , we are sending a clear and positive signal to our eastern partners , and now we await their reaction , not only in political declarations , but also , most importantly , in practical economic and social measures .
we expect them to go down the path of reform and democracy , to reform their justice systems and make them independent of political influences , to fight corruption and to create a positive environment for economic growth .
i am convinced that a democratic and wealthy ukraine , Moldova and - let &apos;s hope - one day also Belarus would be good not just for the inhabitants of those countries , but also for the whole of the european union .
( PL ) mr president , the neighbourhood policy is one of the mechanisms aimed at supporting the creation of an area around the eu where cooperation without conflict is possible , as well as avoiding the formation of a cultural and economic divide at the eu borders .
i agree with the concerns expressed by the authors of the report that it would be a mistake to include the countries around the mediterranean in this same policy .
it would be much better to create an EU-Mediterranean partnership with its own proper mechanisms .
i believe that only those countries that have land frontiers with the european union should be included in the neighbourhood policy .
participation in this policy should be a step to the country in question gaining eu membership , obviously only if this is something that the countries themselves and the eu want .
in the future we will have to think about the creation of a separate EU-Asia policy for cooperation with countries in asia that want to cooperate economically and politically with the european union , for example , countries such as Georgia and Armenia .
we have to separate our activities by region .
( LT ) we are aware of the fact that the aim of the european neighbourhood policy is to create a secure circle of safety and stability around the european union , to develop close relations with neighbouring countries as well as to enable these countries to implement democratic reforms , based on respect for human rights , the rule of law and economic and social development .
my question would be this : what price are we prepared to pay to achieve these objectives ?
having considered past experience i would like to point out that adequate funds are essential for the development of the european neighbourhood policy .
in my opinion , eur 11 billion for a seven-year period for 16 countries is not very much .
more efficient coordination of financial instruments and policies is an essential part of improving the funding of the european neighbourhood policy , and the evolving eu budget reform is an excellent opportunity to lay solid foundations for the much more efficient development of the european neighbourhood policy in the future .
there is no way i could agree with mr Pflüger , that it is just a case of squandering taxpayers &apos; money .
the second point i would like to emphasise concerns relations among eu neighbour states .
it is essential that they maintain good relations and support one another .
no doubt they would be able to solve most of their problems by working together .
in view of this the european parliament should express its forthright support of EURO-NEST - the eu Neighbourhood-East parliamentary assembly - as well as show political determination and offer financial support for the implementation of this project .
EURO-NEST would provide new momentum for more efficient implementation of the european neighbourhood policy while substantially increasing the parliamentary dimension of this policy , within which the european parliament would be able to fulfil its honourable mission .
( pt ) the european union &apos;s role in the world is now absolutely vital if we are to achieve certain balances which are essential to the pursuit of global peace and justice .
the logic of associating with some countries through bilateral agreements in particular must therefore not undermine the development of a multilateral approach that a global vision requires of us .
the undeniable influence of universal human rights and the guarantee of fundamental freedoms in the eu &apos;s relations with the world must underpin any dialogue with any partner in the world , especially in connection with the mediterranean region .
because of this region &apos;s geographic proximity to europe , its age-old affinity , its cultural diversity and its constant political instability , the eu must act very firmly to ensure those fundamental principles .
i therefore congratulate the rapporteurs for the importance they attach to this in their report on the european neighbourhood policy .
the proposal tabled by president Sarkozy , meanwhile , on the mediterranean union is completely out of context .
although it is extremely useful because it revitalises the debate on the mediterranean , it proposes on the one hand to dismantle the current partnership while , on the other , it disowns the eu &apos;s fundamental principles regarding the supremacy of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms in particular , considering them to be secondary issues according to a case-by-case pragmatism that would foster a multi-speed relationship .
it is not our role to foster the slow-down our partners take refuge in , or to foster divisions .
we must promote development and progress , especially in terms of rights , while always guaranteeing that we use our investments to provide opportunities for growth and economic development as a whole for the entire region .
guaranteeing completion of the free trade area in the region in 2010 , among all its peers , is therefore an achievable objective , but we must never abandon our respect for humanist and democratic values and rights .
( RO ) i appreciate Mr. Tannock &apos;s report .
we need neighbours that meet the european union standards , no matter if and when they become members of the european union .
for this reason , i believe the neighbourhood policy should become proactive , namely we should not only monitor the development of the situation , but also support the given countries in their efforts to meet the required standards .
regarding the situation in Georgia , president Saakaşvili &apos;s decisions to organize early presidential elections , a referendum for establishing parliamentary elections and to lift the state of emergency are salutary .
all these actions will contribute to the restoration of a democratic climate favourable to resuming debates and negotiations for the viable settlement of the sensitive situation in Georgia .
i support the idea of the need to reinstate the mechanisms of the rule of law , freedom of expression and freedom of the media .
i ask all the political forces in Georgia to cooperate in order to draw up a law regulating audio-visual activity , which would prevent situations like the recent one .
the party now governing is the one that , beginning with 2003 , has initiated and supported a coherent system of reforms in key fields that , in their turn , have generated visible economic development , propelling Georgia towards a functional market economy and an authentic democracy .
under the same government , the creation of mechanisms for more efficiently actually implementing the action plan with the european union has been supported and the evolution towards a european direction has been intensified .
at the same time , Georgia has become a strategic partner in the neighbourhood policy , which is indispensable for solving the frozen conflicts in the region , a good mediator , an important partner within regional cooperation and a strategic ally in energy cooperation projects and transport .
the claims and attitude of the opposition should be taken into consideration , but evaluated in the context of the entire political and economic situation , both internally and in the region .
i believe we should carefully watch what happens in the conflict areas in Georgia , as well as the attitude of the russian federation , especially in the context of the near deadline for making a decision on kosovo &apos;s status .
( fr ) mr president , i intend to speak specifically about the mediterranean region which , as the rapporteurs have reminded us - and i thank them for doing so - is very important to europe in foreign-policy terms .
it is my support for substantial european commitment in the mediterranean region that prompts me to warn against the risks of diluting europe &apos;s mediterranean policy within its overall neighbourhood policy .
we do not want to see rivalry developing between eastern european countries and our southern neighbours .
the ENP should bilaterally complement the multilateral barcelona process , which , i would remind you , has been the framework of reference for structuring relations in the mediterranean region since 1995 .
that being so , neither the ENP nor any other project directed at the mediterranean countries should be allowed to obscure or replace the barcelona objectives , based on the three pillars of partnership in political , economic and social development , which are the only way of promoting effective regional integration .
i therefore need to highlight two points .
first , we must maintain a balance in apportioning funding between the eastern european and the mediterranean countries .
our ability to sustain a strong and ambitious european policy for the mediterranean region depends on getting that balance right .
secondly , with regard to the projected euro-mediterranean free trade area - the subject of my report to the house earlier this year - i would emphasise the importance of a coordinated and gradual approach , enabling the countries concerned to cope with the pace and intensity of an open trading system , while taking account of their own specificities and particularly the fragility of some sectors of their economy .
trade that serves the cause of development must remain our aim .
in conclusion , i should like to see these aspects addressed in the report because they are necessary to the definition of a clear mediterranean policy based on a strategic long-term vision of development and stabilisation in this region .
- ( el ) mr president , let me congratulate the rapporteurs on their thorough examination of the topic .
however , i must point out that if one of our basic aims is to create an area of peace , we must pay attention to the political future of the countries in question .
let me cite egypt as an example .
do any of us know what will happen in the post-Mubarak era ?
i fear not .
do we not realise that sooner or later egypt will be taken over by the muslim Brotherhood , a large Islamic extremist organisation ?
we must therefore understand that all our planning in the area will be undermined by such a situation .
i do not want to repeat here , yet again , the proposal i made last year in the previous debate on the report .
i suggested the creation of a commonwealth among these countries in order to strengthen relations in the political neighbourhood .
allow me to end by pointing out that the european political neighbourhood was promoted in tandem with the accession of the ten , with the aim of mitigating the formation of new lines of division with neighbouring countries .
for this reason , the european political neighbourhood must remain unified , geographically cohesive and balanced between its eastern and southern parts .
in addition , since the countries making up the european political neighbourhood display political , economic and even cultural differences , the principle of diversity is as ever crucially important , but it must not be used to widen the gaps between these countries .
mr president , commissioner Ferrero-Waldner was right at the beginning that the ENP should stimulate democratic reform .
the Georgian government has to fully restore the normal democratic process in the country and strictly abide by the principles of the rule of law in all its actions .
in particular , we should express our concerns about the serious violations of the right to free expression and access to information .
what is needed in this situation is resuming the political dialogue and finding a compromise in the interests of the people and democracy in the country .
i am particularly alarmed by the violence exerted by the police force against peaceful demonstrators .
the events of these last days show failure on the part of the government to bear criticism .
the excuse of the alleged plot of a coup d &apos;état , implying some russian influence , is highly controversial to say the least .
moreover , it is clear that any successful opposition challenger , whom at this moment we do not see on the political scene , is highly unlikely to be pro-Russian .
we welcome president Saakashvili &apos;s decision to call early presidential elections .
today &apos;s news that the state of emergency will be lifted is also a positive sign .
from now on , we expect that all the necessary conditions for free and fair elections will be met .
one of these conditions is the freedom of expression , and this means that all media that have been forcibly closed down during the recent developments , like Imedi tv , and Kafkasya tv , should resume their normal activities .
we should be very clear on that .
i believe that president Saakashvili will be bold enough to reverse the negative trends established over the last weeks .
after his election he started a good reform policy in Georgia , which has to be supported .
i also firmly believe that the democratic development of the country should be closely monitored and supported by the european parliament .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , because of the time i will be very brief , though that is in my favour since i will be present at question time .
this has been a long and intense debate , which i think has covered every essential aspect of the neighbourhood policy .
i also believe that broad consensus has been reached on fundamental issues such as the need for the neighbourhood policy to be a comprehensive and inclusive policy geared towards the north but also towards the east and the south .
it must also take the specific characteristics of the countries to which it is addressed into account .
we must of course take our partners &apos; specific characteristics and needs into account , just as we must also use the necessary instruments in line with those needs and specific characteristics .
the european neighbourhood policy has a single objective which is valid for all the partners , which is to establish a partnership leading them towards economic and social progress and towards strengthening the rule of law and their democracies .
i have to say , however , that in this and other forums i sometimes hear the reflection or indeed suggestion and advice that we should possibly increase the resources and possibly increase the instruments .
these are generous ideas that i understand , but we must also be aware that increasing the instruments or increasing the funding , i.e. the resources , very often simply does not work because our partner countries &apos; absorption capacity is limited .
we would obviously like to see an increase in resources too , but the truth is , as i have said , that our partners &apos; absorption capacity is very often limited , so giving them more financial resources will not make the programmes more effective or the results quicker or more visible .
i believe the commission has made the right choice of areas in which partnerships should be established with the countries which are in these associations with us .
the commission acts in a broad variety of areas , including administrative capacity building , reinforcement of the judicial system and the provision of support for civil society organisations and for education and training - a whole gamut of areas are covered by this neighbourhood policy .
as i have said , the single and most important objective is obviously for these partners to be able to experience a development which is also in the european union &apos;s interests .
the council will naturally continue to monitor closely the proposals the commission submits for its approval in connection with the european neighbourhood policy , and is naturally also always prepared to discuss and debate ideas , suggestions and proposals with this parliament .
member of the commission . - mr president , i will also try to be as brief as i can .
i will just say that i think it was a very fruitful debate and i wish again to thank the two rapporteurs .
it was really clear that a great number of members wanted to speak in this very important discussion .
i shall make just a few points in response to some questions .
firstly , it is true that Mauritania is now a partner country in the Euromed process , but it is not a neighbourhood policy country .
i just wanted to make this clarification ; the funds for Mauritania will still come under the acp heading .
on my second point , i wish to be very clear .
there was criticism from some members that human rights , democracy and the rule of law were not our major objectives .
on the contrary .
if you look at any of the action plans , one of the major parts is always a basis for developing as much as possible human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
but , of course , it takes time and we are working particularly with those countries on the question of the judiciary and the justice system , which is , of course , a basis for making differences on the ground .
then one of the members of the independence / democracy group said that he did not want to have more migration .
i want to tell him that visa facilitation always goes hand-in-hand with readmission agreements , so we are trying to combat illegal immigration , but we also want to try to facilitate people-to-people contact and sometimes apply some ideas for legal immigration , which is also necessary for many of our countries because of the ageing population .
fourthly , on frozen conflicts , of course the neighbourhood policy alone cannot solve all frozen conflicts .
for that , we also have special representatives of mr solana , the secretary-general of the council .
but with the neighbourhood policy we are trying to create the best enabling environment for that .
and that is highly important : in israel and palestine , when we speak about the Maghreb and when we speak about the countries of eastern europe .
there was another question with regard to israel &apos;s special status .
i can tell you , as i told the foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , when we met her in lisbon , that we have a special reflection group .
the reflection group is working .
the ideas on the table are very ambitious , particularly from the israeli side .
but , we have to see that it fits into the overall coherent framework approach of the neighbourhood policy .
but within that we can certainly do a lot .
and this is what we are reflecting on and discussing at the moment .
i imagine that , next year , under the next association council , we will hopefully come up with proposals for that .
so we have not forgotten it ; we are working on it .
a last word on Georgia : many colleagues who have spoken on Georgia , including my friend Lydie Polfer , have said that the situation is very complex .
we all know that , on the one hand , there are great tensions between the opposition and the government , but , on the other hand , there might be also other tendencies there .
i therefore think it is highly important that president Saakashvili has called for presidential elections .
he has said that he will consult the population on the date for parliamentary elections .
and i do hope that the reform aspect that we have really tried to promote will go on in the future , otherwise confidence in the Georgian government will be very much damaged if the current crisis cannot be solved in a democratic way .
but , of course , we will try to do everything to support Georgia .
my last point is on financing .
many have said that we need more funds .
but you should know that the european investment fund or investment facility that is always mentioned is an opportunity to give more funds to those countries that need them with regard to infrastructure projects , energy , transport and so on.We have therefore said that what we have is maybe not sufficient .
therefore , let us have more .
the debate is closed .
i would like to remind you that the Raimon Obiols i Germà and Charles Tannock report will be put to the vote tomorrow morning , and that the texts submitted to close the debate on the council and commission statements will be put to the vote in brussels on 29 november 2007 .
written statements ( rule 142 )
in writing . - as the chair of the Moldova delegation , i want to thank mr Tannock for pointing out that Moldova fully corresponds to the criteria necessary for a perspective of membership codified in the maastricht treaty &apos;s article 49 .
thanks also to his co-rapporteur mr Obiols i Germà for this balanced and thorough report .
Moldova is not in the neighbourhood of europe , it is geographically in europe and should be entitled to join the eu once the three copenhagen criteria are fulfilled .
although the EU-Moldova action plan is far from being completed , we must ask what is the next step ?
more incentives are needed to motivate our partners in europe to make painful reforms .
to achieve its aims , the financial and other resources of the ENP must be noticeably more generous .
full ESDP missions are needed to have a realistic chance of solving the frozen conflicts in Transnistria and the caucasus .
presently there are no resources available to stage those missions .
finally , it is hard to imagine policy which would fit both the countries of geographic europe and the non-European mediterranean countries .
clearly , the scope of the ENP needs to be rearranged in the future .
especially its eastern component needs better definition .
in writing . - ( pt ) i congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work .
the resolution we approve will consolidate parliament &apos;s vision in this area of neighbourhood policy , developing the lines we defined in january 2006 .
for that very reason it is important to approve amendments 1 and 2 , which i thank mr Tannock for presenting .
they reaffirm points we have already approved and that cannot be forgotten now , concerning our neighbourly relations on the south atlantic border .
it is important to recall once again the particular situation of island states neighbouring our outermost regions - the Canaries , madeira and the azores - with which we have historic links and special close ties .
we must also therefore reiterate our request to the commission to propose and to develop specific policies to expand the european neighbourhood policy as far as possible to our island neighbours in the atlantic , close to the european continent , insofar as they highlight not only our geographic proximity but also our cultural and historic affinity and the common interest of mutual security .
along the same lines , i would also like to take this opportunity to applaud the recent communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament on the future of relations between the eu and the republic of Cape Verde .
question time ( council )
the next item is questions to the council ( B6-0382 / 2007 ) .
the following questions were presented .
subject : &apos; Revolving door &apos; immigration policy
some political figures and specialists have raised the possibility of achieving an agreement between the member states which would combine the monitoring of the union &apos;s external borders with a new &apos; revolving door &apos; immigration policy to allow legally established immigrants in the union to return to their countries of origin without fear of encountering a closed door when returning to the eu .
does the council consider this approach feasible , and would it be possible to set up this policy using straightforward intergovernmental cooperation , or would it be necessary to establish new institutional mechanisms to achieve this end ?
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) as the honourable member will know , in may 2007 the commission presented to the european parliament , to the council and to the committee of the regions a communication on circular migration and mobility partnerships between the european union and third countries .
in its communication the commission considers circular migration to be a useful means to be developed at community level to ensure more effective management of migration flows .
in the june 2007 conclusions on extending and enhancing the global approach to migration , the council in turn stressed that legal migration opportunities , including well-managed circular migration , could potentially benefit all partners involved .
the council believes that all well-managed circular migration opportunities should therefore be explored in close cooperation with all the relevant parties , with a view to the adoption of council conclusions not later than the end of 2007 .
the need to examine these circular migration opportunities , based on the communication from the commission of 16 may 2007 , was also reiterated in the conclusions of the june 2007 european council .
the council is currently examining the issue of the adoption of specific instruments and measures to facilitate circular migration , and the issue of finding out how such measures may be implemented .
the commission has not as yet proposed any specific measures .
( es ) mr president , i believe the portuguese presidency is devoting a fair amount of attention to this matter , i believe the reply was accurate .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) mr president , i would like to thank the honourable member for his kind words .
the presidencies are indeed always a little shorter in the second half-year , whether fortunately or unfortunately i am not sure , because of the summer holidays .
we would in fact like to make further significant progress on this matter by the end of the year , but we are also obviously dependent to some extent on the initiatives the commission wishes to present to allow us to do so .
that would be our intention and our desire .
at this time i cannot guarantee that , however , but if possible and if we have the opportunity , we will certainly take it .
( es ) mr president , i share the view of the presidency of the council on the revolving door policy for immigration and the new ideas on blue cards to attract immigrants of high calibre .
i would , however , like to ask the presidency of the council if it is convinced that we will be able to contain the huge inflow of immigrants to the european union we have each year , in view of the fact that there are countries in the world whose level of development is so poor and so low .
( pt ) the question i would ask on circular immigration is whether there should not be a special mechanism to provide for such immigration , particularly in terms of providing training in the countries affected .
i am thinking of doctors and nurses from Malawi who are in the uk , for example .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) in may 2007 the european parliament and the council approved three decisions : the decision creating the european refugee fund 2008-2013 , the decision creating the external borders fund 2007-2013 , and the decision creating the european return fund 2008-2013 .
in june 2007 the council also approved the decision creating the european fund for the integration of third country nationals 2007-2013 .
these four decisions are an integral part of the general programme &apos; solidarity and management of migration flows &apos; .
in line with the objectives laid down by the european council , the objective of this programme is the fair sharing of responsibilities among member states with regard to the financial burden arising from the introduction of the integrated management of the eu &apos;s external borders and the implementation of common asylum and immigration policies .
the european refugee fund complies with the obligations set down in article 63 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the ec treaty on the adoption of measures promoting a balance of effort between member states in receiving and bearing the consequences of receiving refugees and displaced persons .
the council also seeks to promote solidarity by other means .
that was a comprehensive statement of the theoretical position on burden-sharing .
we know what the instruments are , but i have to ask you candidly , when it comes to malta , Lampedusa and the Canaries , what is the implementation ?
do you feel that , over the last six months , council members , including those in western europe , have taken seriously their burden-sharing commitment regarding these places , which are in an emergency situation ?
some of our colleagues here know it and see it every day .
nobody is identifying portugal as being in any way apathetic on this issue , but what about the council actively carrying out burden-sharing ?
is it being implemented ?
please give us your candid response .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) i am very pleased to answer the honourable member , and obviously i am speaking on behalf of the portuguese presidency in accordance with its thinking on this issue .
the honourable member knows that migration and migration flows , especially illegal migration flows , particularly from regions to the south of europe , represent a new problem that we did not have to face just a few years ago .
we must obviously , therefore , react to this new and unfamiliar phenomenon and must take appropriate measures .
as is always the case , however , those measures , that reaction and the instruments referred to are taking shape gradually , just as our awareness of the importance and gravity of this problem is taking shape gradually .
i have to say in this regard that the keyword in this issue for the portuguese presidency and for portugal as a member state is solidarity .
just as we all understand that when other issues affect one or two member states they must be seen as a problem for everyone , so too in connection with illegal migration the appropriate word is also solidarity , since we are aware that these phenomena often affect individual states in particular .
it is true that quite often all we do is talk , and it is true that we must and should do more than just talk .
however , the current awareness that the issue concerned is a global problem that affects everyone and that is everyone &apos;s responsibility is a first step .
naturally we are confident that gradually and realistically , but also with the necessary urgency , we can continue to refer to &apos; solidarity &apos; while turning it into concrete actions and measures .
that is the presidency &apos;s role , and that is what portugal must do as a member state .
you will also understand that it is not up to a single member state or a single presidency to influence all events and all measures , as might perhaps be desired .
but i can assure you that there is a heightened and increasingly strong awareness that we must share that responsibility and give effect to that solidarity .
( MT ) with all due respect , president-in-office , i am not convinced by your reply , as while the council of ministers are thinking about it , there are people drowning in the mediterranean and there are mediterranean countries that cannot cope with the emergency ; that is why i am not convinced .
i am going to ask you something specific : malta made a proposal in the council on the division of the burden , on burden sharing .
it asked that any immigrants saved from the sea outside eu waters - in libya &apos;s waters , for example - should be divided among all the eu countries .
what was the council &apos;s reply , i would like to know .
subject : measures to ensure decent living conditions for illegal immigrants , particularly women and children
which measures does the council intend to take to ensure that illegal immigrants , particularly women and children , enjoy decent temporary living conditions , so that member states uniformly respect their international commitments ?
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) mr president , i do not know if this is possible or within the regulations , but when the question is introduced i would like to know exactly which of the honourable members is the author , because obviously my answer will be addressed firstly to them .
as i am sure you know , the proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council on common standards and procedures in member states for returning illegally staying third-country nationals lays down specific rules for the treatment of such nationals .
article 13 of the proposal for a directive provides for safeguards as to the conditions of stay pending the return of all persons covered by the directive .
article 15 , which establishes the conditions of temporary custody , defines the treatment to be afforded to third-country nationals pending their return .
article 15 ( 3 ) states that particular attention must be paid to the situation of vulnerable persons , and specific provision is made for minors .
as you also know , the european parliament and the council are currently examining this proposal for a directive .
- ( el ) thank you , mr president ; allow me to repeat mr Moraes &apos;s comments : you are theoretically answering our questions very well and in detail .
however , what is the responsibility of the member states when we do not yet have your analyses ?
are there any international treaties and are they being applied equally to all member states , or do some member states , for special reasons , provide more or less ?
what is the responsibility of the accession countries that serve as transit routes for illegal immigrants , mainly women and children ?
during yesterday &apos;s sitting i mentioned to the commissioner that even a 14-year-old illegal transporter of clandestine immigrants had been arrested .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) i have just said that a proposal for a directive is currently under discussion between the council and the european parliament in which this issue is addressed .
since the proposal for a directive has not yet been approved , i cannot say exactly what measures the directive will propose for defending and protecting the weakest individuals who need the most protection .
we shall see .
this proposal for a directive now addresses that concern to protect the weakest .
i can also clearly tell you that when we , the portuguese presidency , refer to the question of illegal immigration , we always say that the fight against it is based on two fundamental principles : solidarity and respect for people and respect for the humanitarian tragedy underlying the phenomenon .
we should not treat people as objects , and neither the presidency nor portugal accepts or has ever accepted that the humanitarian dimension should not be considered or should be considered to be secondary in these situations .
this is our position in principle as the presidency , it is our position in principle as an eu member state , and it is a position that we will not abandon under any circumstances .
subject : european security strategy
what are the results to date of implementing the european security strategy ?
in particular , what are the results of extending the security zone to include europe &apos;s periphery ?
is the council satisfied with the strategies &apos; peace through regional integration &apos; and &apos; regional integration through peace &apos; on the eu &apos;s geopolitical perimeter ?
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) mr president , honourable member , in the four years that have elapsed since the european security strategy was adopted in december 2003 , the european union &apos;s foreign and security policy has developed dynamically .
we have reacted successfully to the threats identified in the european strategy , following the main thread that informed our approach .
we have had to be more active , more coherent and also more competent .
the new threats of terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , regional conflicts , degeneration of the state and organised crime have been met by many concrete actions that reflect the range of instruments currently available to the european union .
these include diplomatic action , civilian and military missions and trade and development activities .
we have endorsed effective multilateralism , supporting and increasing our cooperation with the united nations in crisis management , the war against terrorism and non-proliferation .
our operations in relation to european security and defence policy are our most visible contribution to global peace and security and demonstrate our willingness to take on global responsibilities .
since 2003 we have initiated 16 crisis management operations , four military and 12 civilian , in various parts of the world .
these european security and defence policy operations cover three continents and range from purely military operations , including reform of the security sector and institutional development , to police missions to ensure the rule of law .
from Aceh to Ramallah , from Kinshasa to Sarajevo , the eu is putting the main catalysts for peace and stability into place .
the pressures on the union are increasing , however .
we have just decided in principle to lead a military mission to Chad and the central african republic to help to draw a close to the regional consequences of the Darfur crisis .
we are also prepared to lead a police mission to ensure the rule of law in kosovo .
from the western balkans and from eastern europe to the mediterranean , we have worked actively for peace and stability in our neighbourhood using all the means at our disposal .
- ( el ) thank you for your answer , mr president .
i really feel that the european security strategy is proving more successful in missions outside the european continent than in meeting challenges arising within the eu .
i believe that situations such as that in kosovo , the management of an emerging crisis , the policy of conditionality in FYROM , a candidate country whose political system is seriously ailing , and the Russophobia , whether justifiable or not , that preoccupies our colleagues from the countries of the former eastern europe - all these challenge us to form a more coherent and effective european security strategy .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) we have just had a discussion here in this plenary session on the european neighbourhood policy intended precisely for our partners on this continent .
i presume that a general conclusion was that , despite the difficulties that might exist and the improvements that could be introduced , this european neighbourhood policy that forms part of our strategy has worked well and has ensured that many of our partners and neighbours can enjoy stability , economic progress and economic and social development .
for well-known historical reasons , many of our partners are naturally now experiencing what could be called stages of transition , democratic consolidation and consolidation of the rule of law , and as is so often the case , these processes are not exempt from difficulties , upheavals or problems .
and this is perhaps true of some of those countries .
we recently spoke about Georgia , when i said here that i chaired the association council with Georgia some three weeks ago and had the opportunity to inform our Georgian colleagues that in the area of the economy , for example , we were pleased to note that significant progress had been made in terms of economic development , despite the problems that country has with russia .
we must therefore be prepared for the significant progress that we expect and want , but for well-known reasons we must also sometimes expect backward steps that we sincerely hope will only be temporary , and we hope that the states and countries will rapidly return to progress and towards reinforcing the rule of law .
i must therefore tell the honourable member in all sincerity that , although we european union citizens sometimes tend to be very modest with regard to the capacity of our achievements and to the achievements themselves , we must be a little more friendly towards ourselves , as it were .
i think that we have achieved something despite the difficulties .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) as the honourable member knows , the council does not comment on speeches by heads of state of european union member states .
naturally , however , i have noted president Sarkozy &apos;s opinion , which is that of the head of state of a very important eu member state .
i do not have a crystal ball and therefore cannot tell you how far this idea will go .
we shall see , but since it is a proposal from president Sarkozy , it will obviously be listened to very attentively , like all his proposals .
subject : accession negotiations with macedonia
what is the council &apos;s assessment of the stage reached in bringing macedonia closer to the eu , and when does it consider that it will be possible or desirable to set a date for starting accession negotiations ?
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) mr president , honourable member , the december 2005 european council decision to grant candidate country status to the former Yugoslav republic of macedonia was recognition of that country &apos;s reform achievements .
in its interim reports the commission has examined developments in detail .
following the assessment of the situation in the former Yugoslav republic of macedonia , as set out in the commission report of 2006 , in its session of 11-12 december 2006 the council regretted that the pace of reforms observed had slowed down in 2006 .
on 14-15 december 2006 the european council reiterated that each country &apos;s progress towards the union would continue to depend on its efforts to comply with the copenhagen criteria and the conditionality of the stabilisation and association process .
the council called for the former Yugoslav republic of macedonia to accelerate the pace of reforms in key areas and to implement the priorities identified in the european partnership in order to move ahead in the accession process .
the fourth meeting of the stabilisation and association council between the european union and the former Yugoslav republic of macedonia took place on 24 july last .
particularly important among the messages set out in the union &apos;s common position for the stabilisation and association council was its insistence that stability and the regular functioning of democratic institutions were fundamental aspects of the political criteria essential for ensuring progress towards european integration .
institutions such as the government , parliament and the president must function and cooperate effectively .
they must also play their differentiated roles and interact as laid down in the constitution .
a constructive political climate must be established and maintained so that the country can concentrate on the reforms necessary to make progress towards the union .
further efforts must also be made to establish confidence between the ethnic communities at all levels .
the union recalled that sustained implementation of the Ohrid framework agreement was a key element of the political criteria .
every effort must be made to achieve the broadest possible political agreement on the associated reforms , in full compliance with the letter and spirit of the agreement .
the meeting also recalled the importance of making progress in the areas of justice and internal affairs , particularly in combating organised crime and corruption .
at the same time the council also recalled that regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations were an essential part of the process of eu integration .
finally , i wish to state that the council is examining very carefully the commission report published on 6 november , which will be the subject of conclusions at the general affairs and external relations council in december next .
( de ) thank you , mr president-in-office , for your very comprehensive reply .
i have only two brief supplementary questions .
firstly , do you think it conceivable that a date for the opening of accession negotiations will be set in the course of next year ?
macedonia &apos;s applicant status dates from more than two years ago , and it is surely high time to think about a date .
my second supplementary question is this : what approach is being adopted ?
are attempts being made to link macedonia &apos;s accession with that of other countries , such as serbia , or is this country really being dealt with separately from any others ?
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) as the honourable member will understand , i cannot say whether we are or are not in a position to set a date in the coming year for starting accession negotiations with the former Yugoslav republic of macedonia .
difficult and demanding conditions and criteria must be met before such negotiations can begin , so the former Yugoslav republic of macedonia will be further from or closer to being informed of the date for starting negotiations according to how far it meets those criteria and conditions .
what i would say , however , is that the candidate country will be better placed to answer that question than the european union .
as regards connecting accession processes , the presidency maintains and has always maintained that each candidate state must be judged separately on its own merits .
if the candidate state is eligible because it meets the commitments and conditions for starting accession negotiations , it should be granted that status irrespective of what might happen in parallel processes involving other candidate states .
subject : tiger conservation
what has the eu done , and what further measures are under consideration , in order to encourage and assist india and other relevant countries in the conservation of their tiger populations in a way that involves local people and gives them a stake in the protection of those animal populations ?
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) mr president , honourable member , the convention on international trade in Endangered species of Wild fauna and flora , or CITES , provides the international legal framework for the conservation of tigers and other endangered species .
the eu and its member states are strong supporters of CITES , both politically and financially .
in recent years the eu has laid particular stress on the need for greater concentration of effort in the practical application of CITES controls in order to reduce illegal slaughter and trade and to guarantee sustainable trade of species .
to underscore this need , the commission published recommendation no 207 / 425 / ec of 13 july 2007 , identifying a set of actions for the enforcement of council regulation ( ec ) no 338 / 97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein .
meanwhile , the species &apos; pantera tigris &apos; is listed in annex a of commission regulation ( ec ) no 1332 / 2005 of 9 August 2005 , and is also listed in annex i of CITES , which means that specimens of that species can only be moved in exceptional circumstances , subject to rigorous criteria .
if those criteria are to be met and any decision to authorise trade is to be possible , assurances must be forthcoming that the activity is not detrimental to the state of conservation of the species .
we would also draw your attention to the need for international cooperation and in particular for capacity building to facilitate the implementation of policies for the conservation and sustainable use of wild flora and fauna in states where such species are found .
the eu thus supported the decisions relating to asian big cats , approved at the 14th meeting of the parties to CITES at the beginning of this year , with the aim of intensifying application and conservation efforts .
we are , furthermore , also prepared to provide assistance to india and to the other states of the distribution area in implementing these decisions .
we recognise that the effective implementation of conservation measures requires the participation of the local population .
we have stressed the need , through CITES , to ensure the support and cooperation of local and rural communities in managing wild fauna and flora resources , and consequently in combating illegal trade in them .
i thank the presidency very much for that , and i will read the documents mentioned .
however , the problem is that the situation regarding tigers is a crisis .
there are probably only 3000 left in the wild .
they could be extinct in the wild by 2020 .
the main problem is poaching , which is driven by the lucrative illegal trade in tiger skins and parts , said to stretch to eastern europe .
the indian forestry authorities say they are unable to cope with poaching gangs , due to chronic underfunding .
can the eu help with that ?
have we got specific projects ?
a chinese official said recently that it is very hard to resist pressures to open the tiger trade .
surely the key is education on the one hand , but also giving local people an economic stake in maintaining higher levels .
what is the eu actually doing in terms of specific projects ?
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) the honourable member will note that i have referred extensively , at length and in detail to the international legal and judicial framework in which the european union exists and operates .
i have also naturally expressed the council &apos;s willingness , readiness and commitment to do its utmost within that international framework to ensure that the measures it provides for are effectively applied .
i have also said very transparently that we also recognise that we must work together with local populations that have direct contact with those endangered species .
the battle against poaching and similar illegal activities is not an easy one , as people with experience of these situations know .
they are aware that it is a difficult yet necessary battle , an assessment with which i agree .
the whole of european public opinion is with you , because what has been seen recently in connection with the illegal trade in endangered species shows that people are much more aware of the need to draw attention to these issues than they used to be .
the pressure of public opinion and the attention paid to it in connection with these situations is therefore now much greater than it was .
you can therefore obviously count on that public awareness , which is also necessary to ensure that we , the eu , and our member states are able to act more effectively .
as i said , we must recognise that it is a difficult battle .
mr president-in-office , you have made it very clear that you and the council as a whole are committed to the protection and conservation of the tiger .
the indian prime minister equally has , in a number of statements , made his passionate commitment to defending the tiger clear .
as we are engaged in a bilateral negotiation with india to create a new bilateral treaty between the eu and india , do you think this is a subject we could include in that treaty and that we could go beyond our current commitments under CITES to help with education , training , conservation - the sort of measures that Baroness Ludford was talking about ?
( de ) mr president , mr president-in-office , my question has to do with this issue but relates to a slightly different aspect .
i believe - and you rightly referred to this - that questions such as the one under discussion arouse strong feelings among the general public .
on the other hand - and you also referred to the legal position - are we in the european union really justified in arrogating legislative or contractual powers to ourselves on every issue that deeply concerns anyone in the eu ?
or should we not exercise a little restraint in these matters ?
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) very well , i must confess , mr president , that i did not fully understand the second question , perhaps because of delays in the interpreting .
as regards the question of the tiger and dialogue with india , i must say in all sincerity and frankness that it is a specific question , on which i have not reflected , but on which we will reflect in the future , and i therefore take note of the honourable member &apos;s suggestion .
in our bilateral dialogue with india - an EU-India summit is to be held - we may also discuss this issue of protected species and how we can better protect endangered species .
i must confess that because of the interpreting , i believe , i could not understand your second question .
( de ) thank you very much , and my apologies for having spoken so quickly .
i was consciously trying to avoid overrunning .
i mean it is important that we deal with such concerns when they matter to the people of europe .
on the other hand , we should also be aware of the legal limits of the union and take care to respect these limits as far as we can .
the approach you have proposed seems interesting , but we should not leave ourselves open to the accusation that the union is claiming competence for all global matters .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) i agree with the honourable member , the european union cannot and should not be responsible for everything , and should not be accused of or judged for everything .
according to the treaties , many of those aspects and responsibilities lie with the member states , and in this case may be responsibilities both of the member states and of the states in which these situations occur .
the european union is not and cannot be a universal panacea , particularly since there is a principle , the principle of subsidiarity , that must always be respected .
subject : non-eu financial services centres
will the council make a statement on how it engages with non-eu financial services centres on areas of mutual concern ?
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) mr president , honourable member , in the conclusions adopted in may 2006 , the council welcomed the commission &apos;s white paper on financial services policy from 2005 to 2010 .
the council particularly welcomed , and i quote : &apos; the ideas put forward with respect to the growing importance of the external dimension in financial services - namely to deepen and widen regulatory dialogues with third countries and work towards the further opening of global financial services markets &apos; .
on the portuguese presidency &apos;s initiative , on 9 october last the ecofin council examined the state of play regarding macroeconomic , financial and regulatory dialogues with the union &apos;s principal partners - the united states , japan , russia , india and china .
the importance of these strategic dialogues was stressed during the discussion .
such dialogues make it possible to reinforce convergence , cooperation and mutual understanding between global partners , thereby helping to facilitate access to the respective markets and to promote macroeconomic and financial stability , particularly in financial services .
the dialogues have led to significant progress concerning convergence and equivalence of accounting standards .
the council supports the work carried out by the commission , and considers that financial market globalisation requires increasing effort to achieve convergence and cooperation at international level , in line with the commission and the council &apos;s strategic vision on the need to reinforce the lisbon strategy &apos;s external dimension through the promotion of and an international approach to regulatory cooperation and the convergence and equivalence of standards .
stress was also laid on how important it is for the european union to ensure a coherent approach in this area , and it was considered that information on the development of such dialogues should continue to be forwarded to the council on a regular basis .
i would like to thank the council presidency for its reply .
is this council presidency aware that there is a school of thought that says that the developing world could greatly benefit from having a financial services sector ?
given portugal &apos;s experience in africa in particular , could i ask the council president , if he does not have the response there in his brief , if he would cause this issue to be examined and pursued , because it may well be a way of assisting not just the developing world but in having global interchanges , which would be of great benefit to this part of the world as well .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) the honourable member is right , i do not have a written answer in my brief to give you , but i will give you my opinion .
in this respect we had a very interesting discussion this morning on globalisation , when we also discussed financial services and questions related to the turbulence on some financial markets .
in this context , therefore , the financial or other instruments , initiatives or mechanisms that could actually put africa with all of us , with the european union and with other major emerging blocs , on the agenda of the talks , debate and theme of globalisation can only be welcomed .
thank you , president and president-in-office for being on overtime as we all are ; we appreciate that .
what do you think are the obstacles to greater progress in this area , and do you think that , as things stand , enough is being done ?
because what we are talking about is consumer confidence in the financial services sector , both within europe and outside .
president-in-office of the council . - ( pt ) this issue , the conduct of these dialogues and so on in this specific area , which is part of the question i was asked , has been directed by and is the responsibility of the commission .
i also have to confess that i am not a financial specialist and therefore do not have the detailed knowledge required to give you a technical answer .
you are asking for a technical answer and i cannot give you one .
i can give you a political answer that will outline a new reality , a new problem and a new challenge , but also a new opportunity .
this problem should be and has now been examined and has been developed to an unprecedented extent .
we in the european union too must naturally seek appropriate answers when problems arise , and the necessary instruments must also be at our disposal when it is a case of developing and making progress .
i cannot tell you specifically what obstacles may have arisen or may arise , though i can give you an idea , as i have , of what the eu &apos;s policy and the council &apos;s responsibilities in this field have been .
finally , i can say that it gives me great pleasure to be able to extend my stay here with you , particularly since this mandate is coming to an end .
i only have one more opportunity to be with you , so i must make the most of this experience .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers ( see annex ) .
question time is closed .

trade and economic relations with ukraine ( debate )
the next item is the report by Zbigniew Zaleski , on behalf of the committee on international trade , on trade and economic relations with ukraine .
rapporteur . - ( PL ) the report illustrates the role that we envisage for ukraine against the background of our own economic activities as well as as a partner in the context of trade with other countries .
in addition we wanted to emphasise the role that ukraine plays in the black sea region , that is , its political , economic and cultural role .
i believe that economic activities and development should progress irrespective of the political ideas held by a country .
the economy must be free , state and legislative authorities should provide support , individual businessmen and groups of entrepreneurs should constitute economic entities .
the economy should be an instrument to bring good living conditions to the citizens , and this objective can be achieved by raising living standards , improving working conditions , through good education , a good justice system , including ownership rights .
we cannot allow common property to be used for individual gain .
encouragement should be given , also motivation , for people to work honestly to bring material and other personal benefits .
if one does not have one &apos;s own good models or history , it is worth taking advantage of others &apos; good practices and experiences , those of one &apos;s neighbours .
for this reason it is important to include ukraine in the common market and make the know-how developed in the eu available to it .
i believe that our economic model is good , even though it is far from perfect , for example with regard to production and trade in food , but we are making constant efforts to improve ourselves .
we can offer to our neighbour from the other side of the river bug the standards and rules that we have found to work .
what does the report cover ?
it covers industry , agriculture , energy , finance , border guards , transport infrastructure , examples of non-corrupt activities , intellectual property , the natural environment , scientific cooperation and relations with neighbours .
these are parts of a single whole that we call the economy .
there are well-defined standards that form the basis of that economy and , in the report , we recommend that our partners develop such standards for themselves or abide by them .
what conditions does ukraine have to fulfil in order to negotiate better links with the european union ?
as essential conditions , i believe , first of all , joining the world trade Organization and , while so doing or even before , resolving the debt problem with kyrgyzstan .
this process is already under way .
secondly , approval of membership by the Ukrainian parliament as quickly as possible .
other conditions include good relations with its neighbours , that is , with russia and Belarus , stability in its currency , the quality of financial services , developing brands in international markets and keeping to the letter of the law .
ukraine , which has declared its desire to join the european union , faces great , even enormous , challenges .
namely , convincing europe by its economic , legal , financial and political activities that it is a sufficiently committed partner for the eu to ask itself , sooner or later , would it not be worthwhile to include ukraine in the common european entity ?
commissioner , our approaches may sometimes have been different , but i believe that we have the same objective , which is to develop a beneficial modus vivendi , a way to coexist with this important eastern neighbour .
i think , mr president , that i have saved some time as it is already evening .
member of the commission . - mr president , first of all let me congratulate the rapporteur , mr Zaleski , on this very good report .
i also want to thank the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation with the commission services when drafting this report .
the report is very timely .
it provides a comprehensive overview of the issues at stake in EU-Ukraine economic and trade relations .
allow me to focus on some points that you also highlighted in your report .
we consider ukraine a key and valuable partner in our neighbourhood strategy .
we agree with the general spirit of the present report : to bring ukraine &apos;s economy as close as possible to the eu by means of a new enhanced agreement , of which the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement will be a key pillar .
the commission also fully shares your views concerning the need to strengthen the rule of law in ukraine and the importance of ukraine &apos;s accession to the wto .
we strongly hope that ukraine can still complete the wto accession process this year , and we will cooperate closely with the Ukrainian government to this end .
we consider that , once the accession package has been approved by the members of the wto , the multilateral process of accession will have been completed .
ukraine has set wto accession as its priority and we are convinced that it will duly carry out its internal ratification procedures to formalise its membership .
the european union has no interest in further delaying the launch of FTA negotiations and is ready to start as soon as the decision on the accession package has been approved by the members of the wto .
concerning the future FTA , we completely agree that it should be deep and comprehensive , with a strong focus on regulatory alignment .
as for economic relations with neighbouring countries , the report suggests a three-way dialogue : EU-Russia-Ukraine .
we should be very prudent not to duplicate processes on topics already covered in other forums .
furthermore , the question arises as to whether the european union would not risk being drawn into bilateral disputes between russia and ukraine .
we would also question the benefit of such an approach .
it is our policy to favour the opening-up of energy markets to competition as a means of ensuring access to secure and affordable energy .
this will be an important subject in the future FTA negotiations with ukraine .
as for concerns on safeguarding the basic needs of the population , eu legislation on the liberalisation of the electricity and gas sector includes significant provisions with the scope to ensure protection of consumers and to safeguard their basic needs .
we intend to negotiate ukraine &apos;s alignment with this legislation .
concerning the suggestion to extend the GSP + to ukraine , i would like to underline that ukraine does not qualify for these additional preferences and that the european union has committed itself not to amend the basic GSP criteria on an ad hoc basis .
in addition , this would severely undermine our negotiating positions for the future FTA .
in conclusion , allow me to once again congratulate the rapporteur on his good report .
the commission widely shares its general approach , except on the few issues that i have underlined above .
the commission will take the report into account in its ongoing and future cooperation with ukraine .
on behalf of the ppe-de group . - ( PL ) mr president , although the post-electoral situation in ukraine has not yet stabilised , those who represent democracy have won .
this is a victory not just for democracy in ukraine , but also for the european union itself , which supported this kind of activity .
now , in the interests of ukraine , the Ukrainians and the european union , we must consolidate what has been achieved with such great difficulty in ukraine .
it is the Ukrainians themselves who have to take the post-electoral decisions , but we can help ukraine and , at the same time , help ourselves .
i fully support mr Zaleski &apos;s report , and congratulate him on preparing such a document .
in my opinion there are three areas that are most important as regards bringing stability to ukraine and also benefit to the european union .
firstly , energy cooperation , which is very important for both sides .
it is essential that we become involved in investment in pipelines that are in many cases in poor condition , as also in new pipelines , such as the one from Odessa - Brody - Gdańsk , in investment in the electricity grid and in supporting energy efficiency .
we can offer our own technologies , we can create joint capital to improve energy efficiency in ukraine , and this will also help our own energy security .
finally , something which is obvious , improvements in nuclear power station safety in ukraine , which is very important for europe .
the second area is scientific cooperation .
ukraine has considerable achievements in this area .
it is worth benefiting from them .
in addition , exchanges of students and scientists , which could reduce the deficit in the european union , where we are short of seven hundred thousand scientists .
we should bear in mind that this is always the surest and fastest method of cooperation : science , educational institutions and students .
thirdly , cooperation between local and regional government .
our eu towns have a great deal to offer in this regard .
we could assist in creating full democracy on the level of local government in ukraine , which is something that has not happened so far .
all this should be made part of a long-term aim , namely an association agreement with ukraine .
it does not matter whether it takes 10 years or 20 .
it is worth presenting ukraine with this opportunity .
it will help Ukrainians , and it will help the european union .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( de ) mr president , in plenary this afternoon we debated the european neighbourhood policy .
following the enlargement round of 2004 , the european commission proposed the development of a coherent strategy towards the union &apos;s new neighbours .
the ENP has created special links with a ring of countries that share the eu &apos;s fundamental values and aims .
our neighbour ukraine is firmly embedded in the ENP .
we are aware of the special geopolitical and commercial importance of ukraine as a natural bridge between the eu on the one hand and russia and central asia on the other .
today the eu is ukraine &apos;s main trading partner ; by 2006 , the volume of trade between ukraine and the member states of the eu had already reached eur 26.6 billion .
we in the european union acknowledge the great efforts that have been made in ukraine in recent years .
the former command economy has been developed into an efficient market economy .
according to the OECD report , ukraine &apos;s economic growth averaged 7.6 % in the years from 2000 to 2006 .
that is a great success .
in february 2007 we began negotiations on a new partnership and association agreement between ukraine and the eu .
the Ukrainian aspirations to eu and nato membership are also well documented .
for reasons of trade and economic policy , accession to the world trade Organization is at the very top of the Ukrainian agenda .
we assume that accession to the wto will prove possible before the end of this year .
this would also considerably broaden the scope for cooperation between the eu and ukraine and smooth the way for negotiations on the creation of a free-trade area in the ENP framework .
the eu must treat ukraine as a genuine partner and give it clear messages .
in this respect i can only welcome the outcome of the EU-Ukraine summit held in Kiev on 14 september 2007 , where the strong and enduring relationship between the two parties was reaffirmed .
we should continue to lend vigorous support to ukraine on its path to wto membership , in the subsequent creation of a free-trade area , and with regard to its european aspirations .
ukraine is a strategically and economically significant eu partner and an eastern neighbour with an important role within and outside the region .
relations between the eu and ukraine have mainly developed in the direction of increasing political cooperation and gradually increasing economic integration .
the implementation of these objectives would contribute towards the further consolidation of democracy and the development of the market economy in ukraine .
however , the success of ukraine &apos;s development does not depend solely on the eu .
ukraine must make a forthright decision to follow the pro-Western direction and follow it consistently .
i would like to share some thoughts about economic and trade relations between the eu and ukraine .
first of all , the start of negotiations for a free trade area with the eu is strictly linked to ukraine &apos;s membership of the wto .
however , negotiations on the-free trade area would cover not just the abolition of tariffs ( which is included in the negotiations with the wto ) , but the more extensive convergence - the liberalisation of the services sector , institutional reforms , the harmonisation of the legal basis with the eu acquis .
accordingly , coordinated actions between the eu and ukraine with a view to creating the free-trade area should develop alongside ukraine &apos;s membership of the wto .
secondly , more attention should be paid to the implementation of good management practice , the intensification of the public sector and the curbing of corruption .
more intense cooperation in these areas would contribute significantly towards establishing more stable economic and trade relations between the eu and ukraine as well as strengthening the process of democratisation and increasing the prospect of ukraine &apos;s membership of the eu .
thirdly , it is important to point out the fact that ukraine &apos;s producers are not yet ready to compete with the producers of eu member states .
therefore , transitional periods should be established , as well as supervisory institutions in order to safeguard against the negative impact on the Ukrainian economy and society .
the fourth point is that while the eu supports the liberalisation of trade with ukraine , it must be prepared for possible difficulties arising from ukraine &apos;s producers , especially those involved in exporting to the cis ; resistance to implementation of eu standards ; attempts by functionaries to maintain the status quo and existing corruptive ties .
to facilitate successful implementation of the reforms the Ukrainian government should inform business people and the public about the advantages of the liberalisation of trade and a free-trade area between the eu and ukraine .
the fifth point is that the intensive development of relations between the eu and ukraine can potentially increase russia &apos;s political and economic pressure on ukraine .
in that case the eu should abandon its role of passive arbitrator , as has happened quite often before , and take on the role of defender of its own interests and those of ukraine .
there is a possibility that russia could apply pressure on ukraine and certain eu countries in the sphere of energy supply .
therefore , the eu should not only make an effort to solve these problems at the highest level , but also , at the same time , seek ukraine &apos;s involvement in the eu common energy market and ensure the security of eu and Ukrainian energy security .
on behalf of the uen group . - ( LV ) the report provides an overview of the current development of ukraine , as an eu partner , and the tasks it still has to carry out , and it deserves praise for the number of issues covered and the depth with which they are assessed .
it is apparent from the report that the author has a deep , personal interest in Ukrainian development issues and in the shaping of its relations with the european union , and this has of course benefited the report .
the rapporteur has carefully and considerately assessed the problems posing a threat to the successful development of ukraine , but at the same time , if we do not call a spade a spade , it is sometimes difficult to anticipate solutions to problems .
it cannot go unremarked that in ukraine &apos;s economy increasing numbers of economic sectors are over-regulated , state intervention is not based on laws and there is a continual increase in the creation of mutually incompatible legislation , which benefits those seeking loopholes in laws and those whose job it is to interpret legislation .
together with the high level of bureaucracy , this significantly hampers the influx of investment into the country &apos;s economy , including that from the european union .
the energy sector is an obvious example of this .
the european union is interested in a transparent transport system for ukraine &apos;s natural gas , which , like the entire energy sector in ukraine , is over-regulated , with artificially complex structures and flows of money that are not transparent .
the european union still does not have the data to allow it to assess the safety of ukraine &apos;s gas transport system .
these are important issues for the european union , which is ukraine &apos;s largest trading partner .
it is to be hoped that ukraine will manage to overcome the protracted political crisis and that the Ukrainian government will in future be involved in eu talks that , on the basis of mutual interest , will make it possible to establish close cooperation .
i agree with the rapporteur that ukraine &apos;s wish to join the european union cannot be ignored , and here i would like to stress this once again : a clear prospect of eu membership is the most effective reform tool that the european union can offer ukraine .
thank you .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE group . - mr president , i would like to congratulate mr Zaleski very warmly on his report .
i think it is a significantly different kind of report to recent ones which have been voted on in the committee on international trade .
compared to the reports on bilateral trade relations of one or two years ago , like the EU-Russia or EU-Mercosur reports , it shows a lot more cautiousness with regard to the benefits of unfettered free trade .
and i think it indicates a growing consensus across the party spectrum on the importance of actively engaging in a political search for how best to submit trade rules to the principles of sustainable development .
in that respect , i think we can be pleased that we have made the most of the various delays at the wto Doha round , which , in a way , have allowed us to conduct this search for more fair and sustainable trade rules in our bilateral trade relations .
i therefore thank the rapporteur for actively seizing this opportunity .
among the many positive signals that this report gives to DG trade for their negotiations with ukraine on a free trade agreement , i would like to highlight four points in particular .
in paragraph 10 , i think the report rightly warns against relying exclusively on export orientation and export diversification in order to make trade sustainable .
instead , it focuses on the importance of developing the domestic market as a necessary basis for any economically sustainable development .
in paragraph 13 , the report suggests the need to strike a balance with regard to investors &apos; rights .
in other words , it insists on a legal framework in ukraine which fosters best practice in corporate social responsibility .
in paragraph 23 , the report suggests a significant shift in our foreign energy supply policy by asking for multilateral rules regarding access to energy resources and by warning not to support the race for the best conditions for unilateral energy access .
finally , in paragraph 36 the report recognises that agriculture is a special activity that cannot be treated in the same way as industrial goods and therefore justifies different tariff rules .
i very much hope that those and other points remain in the final text so that my group can very happily vote in favour of the report .
but i do just want to add that i think it is a pity to hear that DG trade has been objecting to three key amendments proposed by the greens and supported by the rapporteur , which call on DG trade to start negotiations for a bilateral FTA only after the parliament of ukraine has given its assent to the wto accession negotiations .
while DG trade is certainly right that this might delay the bilateral FTA , we have to insist as parliamentarians , as we do ourselves before the conclusion of such FTAs on the part of the european union , for the voice of the people to be taken into account on such an important matter and that includes , of course , the people of ukraine .
we would therefore especially like to thank mr Zaleski for not giving in to that pressure and , once again , for an excellent report .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( de ) mr president , everyone has thanked our honourable colleague mr Zaleski , and i shall do likewise .
his report was adopted in committee without a single dissenting vote , which shows that we can indeed produce a cross-party report if we try hard enough .
allow me to make a few remarks .
the Ukrainian elections have taken place .
they were democratic , they were fair and they were free , but i believe they have left a host of problems unresolved .
the incumbent president has always had difficulties in his dealings with strong prime ministers , whether with Yulia Tymoshenko , whom he dismissed in 2005 , or with Viktor Yanukovych in 2006 and 2007 .
although the coalition agreement concluded between Yulia Tymoshenko &apos;s alliance and the our ukraine bloc exists on paper as the basis of a possible new government constellation , the government has not yet been formed .
nor do we know what will actually transpire , even though the deadline is now quite close .
if this government is formed by then , its first task , in my view , is to tackle constitutional reform , for without reform of the constitution there is no guarantee that the internal stability of the political forces in ukraine will suffice to avoid another fresh set of elections , especially as some people are already thinking about calling for new parliamentary elections at the time of the presidential election .
if you look at certain areas , such as economic policy , the OECD report paints a truly encouraging picture .
it tells us that ukraine recorded average gdp growth of 8.7 % between 2000 and 2006 .
if you look behind these figures , however , you will see a huge trade deficit .
ukraine has a deficit of more than eur 4.5 billion in its trade with the countries of the cis and a deficit of almost eur 4.5 billion with the european union .
in other words , there is still a real need for economic change , and the partnership agreements can and must be used for that purpose .
on the other hand , compared with the statistics of a country such as my own - the federal republic of germany - the Ukrainian figures do seem magnificent .
ukraine &apos;s unemployment rate is lower , its gdp is growing faster , its welfare expenditure on pensions is higher , and it spends a higher percentage of its gdp on education , and hence on investment in the future , than the federal republic of germany .
there is therefore every reason to conclude that the country is unquestionably on the right path .
nevertheless , i referred to problems in the economy , and there are , of course , problems in other areas too .
russia has clearly signalled and plainly stated that its energy prices will rise by 10 % with effect from 1 january 2008 .
that will have a profound impact on the Ukrainian economy .
at the present time , ukraine pays its debts to russia with gas supplies from its own underground deposits .
we shall see how that develops .
it will become a political issue again , and it is important for the european union to intervene to keep the peace .
the russians are entitled to raise their prices , and it goes without saying that the Ukrainians will have to work out how to deal with the economic fallout .
take another point , namely social policy .
during the electoral campaign , all of the parties that stood for election announced vast increases in welfare spending .
if you look at the present coalition agreement between the Tymoshenko alliance and the president &apos;s bloc , you will see that there is no mention at all of an increase in welfare expenditure .
and indeed it would be virtually impossible , given the present level of government revenue , to effect the promised spending increases .
this means that Ukrainian development is not advancing as quickly as is always asserted .
the next point to which i wish to refer is foreign policy .
during the election campaign , all parties promised to move the country closer to the european union .
the party that has always linked this convergence with the european union most closely with the issue of accession to nato , namely the our ukraine party , was the one that suffered the heaviest losses .
an absolute majority of the Ukrainian population are opposed to membership of nato .
i therefore ask the european union to proceed cautiously here .
the majority of the population do not want their country to join nato .
all the available data indicate that they do want it to join the wto .
if we consider , against this backdrop , how the partnership agreements should now be shaped , the real needs emerge in the areas where ukraine still has the difficulties i have listed .
ukraine must - and here i agree entirely with mr Zaleski - have a european perspective , a prospect of accession to the eu .
it would be good for the european union to have a strong partner in the east , and it would also be good for ukraine in view of its general geostrategic orientation .
on behalf of the IND / DEM group . - ( NL ) mr president , our debate on the european union &apos;s trade and economic relations with ukraine , the subject of mr Zaleski &apos;s very thorough report , comes at a crucial time : parliamentary elections have taken place and the country &apos;s economic and political problems need to be tackled vigorously by an energetic new government .
i am thinking of active measures against corruption .
with winter coming , ukraine also needs a strong government which can negotiate with russia on the supply and transit of russian gas .
having read this report , i am inclined to say that europe has made clear what it wants .
the ball is now in ukraine &apos;s court .
the country must have not only an effective government , but also one which demonstrates a political determination to address the problems .
after five elections in as many years , the population is understandably tired of all the political squabbling .
ukraine &apos;s politicians must henceforth be concerned less with each other and more with the country &apos;s political and economic future .
yes , the ball is in ukraine &apos;s court , but i will say more than that , mr president .
the european union has work to do too .
i agree with what our rapporteur says in paragraph 51 , that the european neighbourhood policy suffers from a lack of clear definitions and perspectives .
the prospect of eu membership must be extended to ukraine in the medium or long term .
as part of the european neighbourhood policy , the european union can then initiate or support the reforms needed in the country .
( PL ) mr president , ukraine is a country with strategic importance within the european neighbourhood policy , and it is an important partner for the countries of the european union .
we all hope that growth in trade between ukraine and eu countries will strengthen economic growth and cooperation with countries in the region .
good economic relations are advantageous to both sides .
economic growth in ukraine should take place in parallel with respect for democracy and for the country &apos;s laws .
i am also thinking at this point of respect for the rights of ethnic minorities and , an issue that is important for me , activities that glorify fascism and genocide should not be permitted .
we support democratic and economic processes in our eastern neighbour .
on the other hand , it would seem appropriate to avoid biased and one-sided support for any political bloc in ukraine .
( PL ) mr president , acting as you did earlier i would like first of all to congratulate mr Zaleski on such an insightful report concerning trade and economic relations with ukraine .
the issue of cooperation with ukraine is particularly important at present , and all the initiatives aimed at strengthening cooperation are a clear sign of european interest in our eastern neighbour and of openness on the part of the european union .
the problem lies in the fact that the time when it would be appropriate to put into practice the idea of closer cooperation , going further than the european neighbourhood policy , which has been of little benefit to ukraine so far , is actually coming .
it is undeniable that ukraine still has far to go to approach the community &apos;s economic , political and social structures .
the tasks that ukraine faces have been thoroughly considered in the report .
despite the fact that ukraine can boast of its achievements as regards liberalisation of trade and capital flows , further reforms and strengthening of the Ukrainian economy , which includes membership of the wto , are essential .
despite the european aspirations aired during the orange revolution , ukraine still has to make an unequivocal choice between the european option and the russian one .
if we want ukraine to choose the european option , we must state this clearly and we must give this our support .
the eu should express its interest in contact with ukraine by providing active support on the one hand for changes in ukraine and , on the other , by taking steps within the european union aimed at a gradual transition from a neighbourhood policy to a policy of integration .
for this purpose , steps need to be taken both on the economic front and in the social and political arenas .
it would be appropriate , therefore , to support ukraine &apos;s independence from russia by strengthening economic ties , which means creating an EU-Ukraine free trade area , including ukraine in the community &apos;s power network , and possibly providing finance for the transport system .
it would also be useful to support and implement programmes to promote ukraine in the european union as well as the european union in ukraine , and also programmes to promote the development of science and education , which is an issue raised by professor Buzek .
the most important step as regards changing the image of the european union in the eyes of Ukrainians would be to abolish the visa requirement for travelling to the european union , as well as a clear statement , and this is something of which everyone has spoken , that ukraine will be able to accede to the european union , even if this involves an extended time frame .
( LT ) on 18 october in portugal president Yushchenko announced ukraine &apos;s intention to join the wto this year .
ukraine has already completed negotiations with the wto countries , with the exception of kyrgyzstan , which still insists on recovering the old debt of usd 27 million dating from soviet times .
ukraine &apos;s acceptance into the wto will result in a reduction in import taxes and an increased number of importers .
however , it is important that ukraine implements systematic economic reforms .
despite positive changes , such as the membership of the wto , the public mood indicates the need for serious reforms .
ukraine is developing rapidly .
in recent years there has been significant growth in the gdp , but there is still a lot to be done in the area of economic productivity and competitiveness .
