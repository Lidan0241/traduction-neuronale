finally , voluntary codes do have a role , and reach parts which we cannot regulate .
the recent bomb attacks carried out in the suburbs of Pristina by Albanian-speaking groups and the clashes in north-eastern Bosnia between Muslims and Bosnian Serbs are reviving sources of tension and giving justifiable cause for concern that the region is once more about to erupt .
I am pleased that , at last , we in Parliament have reached a decision on an act relating to textile labelling involving some very substantial proposals for improvements , which the Council is also prepared to endorse and implement .
in Sweden , framework agreements concerning , for example , architectural , medical , auditing , banking and consultancy services are quite usual .
neither side needs to discuss that .
the plan , Mr MacCormick , is not to have them in competition with each other but to extend , if necessary , the appropriate sitting time .
at the same time , we regret the fact that Parliament was unable to agree on the issue of collective agreements also applying to workers from third countries .
consumers are sceptical and will require convincing that the legal framework that is put in place to control and act as the safeguard will ensure the most stringent monitoring of the new arrangements .
I know what I am talking about , Mr Katiforis , for I , myself , have been a smoker .
I am referring here to recital 15 of Common Position No 1 on the food hygiene regulation , according to which good hygienic practices can replace monitoring of critical control points .
at times when crises are brewing , there are courses of action that may perhaps be justified from an objective and abstract point of view , but can nonetheless play a part in making hostilities or a crisis situation more likely .
the Council appealed to both governments immediately to stop assisting and supplying armed groups and to improve mutual relations .
these restrictions will not make the slightest different to the SLORC .
one final remark which is of crucial importance for our group relates to Amendment 113 concerning tax havens .
Madam President , Mr Cercas , working time is an extremely sensitive issue .
Parliament has just given the Commission the green light to continue talks with the WTO but has insisted on restricting their duration and scope .
decent people do not want any part of that , and I deplore what has happened in regard to some recent incidents .
I only ask you to consider it in your subsequent decisions .
in fact , the gap in wealth is stretching every year .
these results are genuinely encouraging , and should persuade the European Union to increase its budget in order to put an end to this worldwide AIDS epidemic .
these amendments are in line with a recasting of the relevant provisions .
I do not agree with the person who told the banks to do less or to be more prudent at this difficult time .
twenty years ago , we had an heroic movement of working people in those countries which brought down the Stalinist monolith .
so I think the questions that were asked should be addressed to the committee as a whole .
I voted for the resolution because the Europe 2020 programme considers research and innovation to be central for emerging from the crisis by means of smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
it is time for loud and strong condemnation of the scant importance that Europe , preoccupied as it is with the eastward enlargement process , accords to its Mediterranean Partnership .
indeed , I want to ask Mr Piebalgs in his reply to explain what the EU is doing to combat continuing and deteriorating human rights violations , in particular , concerning human rights defenders such as Hawa Abdulla from the AU-UN peace-keeping mission , who has been subject to arbitrary detention and beaten .
that is how Belgium ’ s largest political party came to be condemned partly on the basis of a text on female circumcision .
we want an office that can work together with Member States quietly and efficiently .
I think we may come to regret this missed opportunity to get our own house in order ahead of the rest of the world .
all of our countries , after all , are WTO members too .
ultimately we can only secure a single energy market if we have a European regulator with real powers .
I can assure you that the Council , and especially the Dutch presidency , is extremely pleased with the work and achievements of Mr Moratinos in the peace process .
this part remains unchanged .
however , this is not the time to be removing protection .
sometimes it can be proven that they prefer to attend party conferences .
however , it is imperative that the additional data and developments which have come too late be incorporated in this regulation and ensure that it is part of the regulation coming into force on 1 January .
on a more pleasing note , let me move on to my second set of remarks on the 1997 budget .
his abilities were also demonstrated in his immediate response to the problem of Russia and Georgia .
the media was likewise obliged to give as much coverage to the &quot; no &quot; campaign as to the &quot; yes &quot; campaign , without challenging the irrelevancies , despite the fact that all the major political parties , farm organisations , trade unions , press editorials and even the Conference of Bishops urged a &quot; yes &quot; vote .
we agreed that we needed to incorporate the concept of conflict prevention in existing policy instruments to strengthen cooperation with the United Nations , the OSCE and other regional organisations and to find common approaches to cross-border phenomena of destabilisation such as the trade in narcotics , weapons or diamonds .
that is why we would have preferred the company size threshold to have been set at 20 employees .
this will save valuable taxpayers &apos; money .
we also wish to point out some areas where a last minute effort could be made .
Ominously for Moldova , two of the parties involved , namely Russia and Ukraine , issued a joint declaration about the Transnistria conflict , without involving Chisinau , just a month ago , in mid-December 2005 .
by separating the social fund from structural policy , it will be possible to make sufficient funding available to those regions which are not economically underdeveloped and have therefore largely been ignored by EU structural fund policy .
one Member State cannot be allowed to write the rules as it goes along .
written Statements ( Rule 142 )
other countries need to be involved as a matter of urgency in addressing this global problem .
we should perhaps make it clearer to the candidate countries that the right to strike is part of the body of law , or acquis communautaire , which they are expected to introduce .
over the last few months , the study of the Commission &apos; s excellent proposals has made considerable progress .
Mr President , first of all , a word of thanks and support for Commissioner Malmström .
we will only be able to confront this reality with a foundation of good joint agreements .
in order to enable the deployment of these industries , it is equally essential to improve access to funding for professionals in this sector : to introduce microfinancing , develop patronage and public / private partnerships , consider introducing new , innovative funding instruments , and train professionals in the banking sector in the specific characteristics of these industries .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
I await the results of this inquiry with interest .
they are usually more deadly , affecting more civilians and not hesitating to use any means to massacre . they are increasingly total wars .
( de ) Thank you , Mr President-in-Office , for your very comprehensive reply .
I am aware of your report .
the European Union confirms its readiness to support the reform process in Algeria , particularly by way of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation , and to continue the political dialogue entered into with the Algerian authorities .
ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , the success of the Round , the legitimacy and the credibility of the WTO , also undoubtedly depend on civil society feeling the benefits provided by international trade .
I cannot conclude without saying a few words on regional stability .
political areas , such as the Member States , have parties that provide cohesion : France , Spain , Italy , Germany ... all have national parties .
but the Algerian authorities systematically reject any inquiry , on the grounds that it would be an interference in Algerian internal affairs .
there are , at present , four BSE tests , three of them of the very highest reliability and the fourth one quite reliable .
he wanted to purify Kosovo so that the Serbs could regain it , and that is the current situation .
I shall take account of your request .
there is a crucial difference .
we need an authority that has the power to supervise the system in a way that is both rigorous and intelligent with due regard for the complexity of our economies , an authority that is capable of intervening in defence of the common good , so that each Member State can adopt the economic-policy measures necessary to prevent its economy from having adverse effects on the economies of the other Member States .
also , Mr President , please express our solidarity with the victims of the floods in the Mexican states of Oaxaca , Chiapas , and also , above all , Tabasco .
no , Commissioner , that would really be pulling the wool over their eyes .
the time has therefore come to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi and the other shadow rapporteurs , but especially Mrs Hieronymi and , I must say , the Commissioner as well .
this will be an opportunity to say clearly that we want to replace the culture of evil and violence with a culture of tolerance and cooperation .
finally , I would like to say that although , as rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I was obliged to oppose a number of amendments that were absolutely fundamental , it was only in that capacity that I did so , because an agreement had been reached and I had to observe that agreement .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to reiterate the importance of the Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP ) for the economic and trade development of the beneficiary countries .
their implementation is essential to improving the effectiveness of European Union policy on , for instance , European Fund actions and harmonisation of standards for products goods on the Community market .
that means that there is ECU 2500 million on the table , ECU 1000 million of which is completely free and ECU 1500 million of which might be spent in contracts , if the contracts materialise .
- Report : Costa
we have now obtained a mandate from the Council , but negotiations will be necessary in Cancún .
that is the crucial message to the Commission as a condition for even considering approving the accounts for 1997 .
but this is no reason to confuse tax evasion with tax fraud .
SMEs need access to capital markets , research and development , and this is something the Commission must address in the SME programme it presents .
I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to Mrs Grossetête and , above all , Mrs Müller for all her intricate work .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
if people wish to demonstrate , they should do so outside , not inside , this Hemicycle .
tomorrow , Parliament will not be able to do that .
one is the concern Mr Podestà has mentioned about the future of the structural funds and the need for the European Union to determine this when the funds are reviewed in 1999 .
it is about keeping state monopolies , and we know where that leads to : it leads down the road to serfdom .
I subscribe to the report &apos;s long-term objective of trying to introduce fair conditions for all farmers in the EU , which means abandoning the historic criteria for direct payments .
action by the European Union – rather than by individual countries – is therefore needed with regard to legal immigration as well , and not just illegal immigration .
I hope very much that it will get unanimous support from Parliament .
nevertheless , we hope that this postponement - and our committee decision was a unanimous one - will produce greater efficiency and bring more pressure to bear on the Commission .
subject : the European Parliament &apos;s right of initiative
there is actually very little to say on the Oostlander reports .
wide consultation , I believe , is vital and expert advice will be ever more important in a field which is becoming technically more complex .
were we to ask the citizens of Europe whether they would be in favour of allocating money that is not spent to this particular area , the vast majority would say yes .
the President of the Commission is right in saying that Nice is insufficient .
we do not want to add new layers to our bureaucracy ; a small team and proper networking can achieve the same results .
we must support the fundamental message of this report .
at a later point the report seems to suggest the increased use of direct payments for redistribution .
there is therefore no need for me to recapitulate the list of requirements from the perspective of the European Union or to repeat anything about the role of the EU itself .
I would remind you of our interest in observing a balance between the rights and interests which are at stake .
I do not think that it is an assessment document .
we actually think that possibility is rather remote .
the majority of its victims were children and young people , and virtually no schools have remained standing .
Mrs Ainardi , Mr Jarzembowski , Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary have all done splendid work .
at the same time , we should do this in line with standards of caution and , in general , while observing the principle of fair balance .
clear rules on co-existence are required , and rules are also required concerning environmental liability in relation to genetically modified crops .
there has , nevertheless , been a political commotion about alternative assessment , a commotion which , in my opinion has grown totally out of proportion .
the rapporteur rightly refers - within the framework of the LEONARDO programme - to the creation of an &quot; Erasmus for apprenticeships &apos; .
the regulation thus represents a significant step towards patient mobility in the EU .
what will happen to life in the more remote and less profitable geographical areas , which will provide little interest for the private operators in search of profits ?
there are many reasons why I would like to vote in favour of your team , but there is one important reason why I hesitate to do so .
we now need to have the courage to make more of our potential and not only be consulted when the employment policy guidelines are being drawn up - that is not enough .
this can be guaranteed primarily with the support of small and medium-sized businesses , which are one of the main engines within the national economies .
I note first of all that the introduction to the Act that has been agreed upon expressly states that it is neither the aim nor the effect of the Regulation to change national legislation concerning public access to documents .
it is a fact that criticism of the recently decided standards that are being implemented has remained within bounds .
the benefits of coordination conferred by Eurocontrol and ATM , in whose work Finland also participates to some extent , are indisputable .
there are , however , some shortcomings , especially in the field of democratic control .
but at the same time we cannot forget that Italy , which has recently entered the single currency with great emphasis - as stated by Mr Manisco - must show that it knows it truly merits the aid which , I am certain , will be given by the European Union .
we will have the first round and the rest of the debate will have to take place this evening .
the dramatic effects of the so-called austerity measures are highly visible .
Chancellor Merkel did a tremendous job in helping to resolve the issue .
you mentioned the climate change and energy package which is scheduled to be adopted by December .
and there are two policy errors , two basic policies which have caused this problem .
since Britain is not in an earthquake zone , it is almost impossible to conceive of a disaster which would trigger such a payment , so British taxpayers - who contribute a disproportionate amount to the funds - have no realistic chance of benefiting from it .
we would welcome a review of your decision .
to permit swift utilisation of the funds , the EUR 30 million will also be allocated through ECHO .
Mr President , water pollution takes place in rivers , in lakes and in the ground , but it can also take place during transportation .
( applause )
this development would be in contradiction to our vision of a Union which is an association of states , to which the Members freely pay annual contributions .
there is a difference between cancelling and relieving debt .
thank you , too , Mr Březina , for drawing attention to this .
there is also a need to measure quality of life in societies , because in order to ensure and sustain quality of life , it is necessary to take into account important , consensual factors such as health , education , culture , employment , housing , environmental conditions , etc . indicators which measure such factors should be assigned a greater role .
naturally , however , with some of these problems , one can expect the Council to be ready to introduce some initiatives or to express comments .
however , we are also entering a stage of the negotiations where things are getting more difficult : in particular , because some of the outstanding issues are related to inherent differences in our economic structure or regulatory systems .
other states are taking different approaches , but it is not the case that they are doing nothing .
our principal disagreement concerns the way it addresses a pseudo-balance in interlinking so-called &apos; competition law &apos; with media law , in that experience has shown that the interests of capital outweigh all rights and freedoms , including freedom of expression in the media , very often calling pluralism into question .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution , because there is an urgent need to step up efforts at all levels to ensure that the European Union employment guidelines are properly implemented .
if we want to take concrete steps , these will , above all , need to establish benchmarking .
NGOs , government bodies , international organisations and local authorities must work together to deliver multisector emergency assistance to those in need .
we are just about to sweep one of these values under the carpet and my group cannot vote in favour of that .
not merely is this significant , as it takes China into the world community of nations , it also brings China into the evolving new system of decision-making in an increasingly interdependent world .
it needs action . and action needs means and instruments .
I would also like to draw attention to another point that has to be investigated , that is , the rape of many Chinese women in Jakarta during the uprising .
we had not achieved such levels of confidence since the previous expansionary phase .
to turn to my report , at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning in the 1989 European elections , I was stood outside the Royal Ordnance factory in Patricroft in Eccles in my constituency . I was handing out my election leaflets to the hundreds of workers who were changing shifts .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his well-prepared response to the Commission .
it is commendable that international institutions such as the UN , the Council of Europe and the European Union , are addressing this modern form of slavery belonging to the 20th and 21st centuries .
we are aware of the difficulties currently faced by small and medium-sized businesses in taking part directly in tendering procedures , especially cross-border .
the Government of Afghanistan has now called for an inquiry into the use of du munitions in Afghanistan and says that the US military did not inform it that du munitions were being used , particularly in the eastern part of the country .
that is why I voted against the report : it is a really bad idea .
Article 6 of the agreement states that there will be reciprocity insofar as feasible and that it shall be strictly applied .
we have always believed that nuclear power station security and safety is a European issue , and that such issues affect us all , because malfunctioning or other problems affect the public across Europe .
in carrying out that task , they produce reports which are published on the Internet .
they should be collected in computerised form as far as possible , and we should encourage firms to supply them voluntarily , using systems of incentives rather than fines .
it focuses on toys , yet fails to mention clothing containing toxic dyes , dangerous medicines , foodstuffs containing ingredients unfit for human consumption , electrical goods that catch fire , toothpaste made from antifreeze : the list just goes on .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mrs Sandbæk stated that she wanted to knock down the wall .
please believe me when I tell you that the Dutch presidency is in no doubt as to their importance .
it is a question of national security in which the national states , too , must take a strong interest .
the second point is even more serious in my view : the text which we have been presented with cheerfully mixes medical and agricultural issues , so that many members of the European Parliament have the feeling that they are being forced into things .
I shall deal with the comments that were made on the European Court of Justice .
this is a region where human rights are still constantly violated , even in the 21st century .
at the same time , in order to stress Parliament &apos;s involvement even further and given that the consultation procedure is being chosen , we would like the aid to banana producers to be subject to this Parliament &apos;s control by means of the annual budgetary procedure .
I agree with the &apos; how &apos; , exactly as planned by the Commissioner , and I would also like to take this opportunity once again to congratulate the Commissioner and DG XVI . we have worked closely with her and she has helped us immensely in moving cohesion forward during these past five years and , I believe , also for the years ahead .
that is the European response to the US concept of destruction and constructive imbalance and it is , I might add , the only possible solution .
we have , of course , made some progress by quantifying the indicators , but typically here too , there are no detailed , analytical indicators ; the Commission has not proposed analytical indicators , Commissioner , on investments , public , private , infrastructure , on so many things we should like to promote .
it is a terrible indictment on all of us who live in the world &apos;s richest countries that this scale of human tragedy continues to occur into the 21st century .
indeed , a thorough review is becoming urgent .
in any event , Mr President , and with this I shall conclude , I believe we must encourage Mr Solana , the Vice-President of the Commission and our representatives to continue the efforts to mediate and to achieve a de-escalation that they have been making in these three conflicts
one core area of the Lisbon Agenda is better regulation .
Mr President , Russia ’ s announcement of its decision to ban the import of meat and certain meat products from Poland as of 10 November , and to ban the import of plant products as of 14 November , is a source of great concern for Polish farmers and food producers .
I therefore hope that energy companies in EU Member States in particular , that have a great deal of experience of projects in the field of energy efficiency , can share their knowledge with these countries and , Commissioner , it is my special hope that these energy companies then have a real chance as far as projects are concerned and are not just shoved aside by American companies .
( SK ) I would like to express my sadness and profound disquiet over the events which took place in June this year in the Russian Federation .
processing plants are being closed , cultivation areas are dwindling , trees are being grown on arable land and many other actions are being taken that limit food production .
( FI ) Ladies and gentlemen , Russia &apos;s energy resources and our desire to secure deliveries of oil and gas must not be allowed to blur our vision when it comes to the worsening state of democracy and civil rights in Russia .
against this background , it is no surprise that the European Parliament should be less and less happy with international fishing agreements .
lastly , on the subject of re-use , this form of recycling should not be encouraged systematically , because the environmental impact of an item of re-usable packaging is not necessarily less harmful than that of an item of disposable packaging .
I believe that this must once again be clarified .
as to the European warranty , it remains in the proposal .
with regard to the second question , about taking steps to close the loopholes in transposition of the misleading advertising Directive - the European Commission is responsible for this Directive and its implementation , as laid down in Article 211 of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
these two victims mark the beginning and the end of the process of the retreat from democracy in Russia .
I believe that training and guiding these authorities through the process of implementing the programmes will help reduce the high error rate , especially with regard to ineligible expenditure and public procurement .
once again , I would invite you to draft a resolution which seeks to strengthen the position of the small bookseller in a meaningful way .
in writing . - abstention .
Madam President , I listened carefully to the speeches by Mr Lehne and the other MEP who took part in the discussion .
Germany will not be reassured by proposals of this kind .
I want though to reject the criticisms of the Socialist Group made by Jim Nicholson yesterday and again today .
hopefully , the proposal will therefore create an incentive for the car industry to produce cars that consume less petrol and cause less pollution .
cooperation between authorities responsible for enforcing consumer protection and product safety regulations is of key importance for the functioning of the internal market .
the Commission has therefore put forward the Energy STAR Programme as a key measure to reduce the consumption of energy by office technology equipment .
Mr President , it is a great pleasure for me to present the report on the cohesion fund on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy .
it is well-known that the investment services directive is the bedrock of the EU legislative framework in the field of securities markets .
in this sense , the possibility of marketing European agrifoods produce at world level must go hand in hand with the economic development of the less wealthy countries , with mutual respect for local agrifoods production in a global context of balanced growth regulated by both the economy and well-defined rules , but , above all , by the clear need for growth which benefits all to the detriment of none .
in the directives referred to by Mr Cushnahan the Council agreed that duty- and tax-free sales on intra-Community journeys could continue for a transitional period up until 30 June 1999 .
my proposal this evening is that we should engrave the freedom of the press into the marble of the Barcelona Process as an indispensable condition of our partnership agreements .
as the EIB has a good credit rating and the bad debt risk is low , it should adhere to stringent social and environmental criteria when granting loans .
and this is true in all respects .
normally in Denmark we would say to people who made such a fool of themselves , as in this case , that one was forced to fire them .
I also believe that the Joint undertaking must further develop provisions on membership and cofinancing .
the committee also believes that the provision of quality statistical information should be a priority for the Union , particularly now that Economic and Monetary Union has been introduced in the euro area and we have prospects for a further enlargement of the Union .
the European Union expects the Cuban authorities to reintroduce the de facto moratorium on the death penalty ; we call once again upon the Cuban authorities to release all political prisoners immediately and we call for the prisoners not to be subjected to suffering or inhumane treatment in the meantime .
we ought to be able to give a humanitarian right of residence to the victims of trafficking in human beings and domestic slavery , and we ought to be able to guarantee that people who are arrested and held at police stations are given immediate access to legal and medical assistance and , where necessary , to an interpreter .
that is why many Iraqis flee their country and over two million people have become internally displaced .
I hope it will be adopted .
the fact is , the EU has not done much other than make payments and adopt statements .
when we talk about the polluter-pays principle , the multinationals must be held accountable for the fact that conventional farmers , and in particular organic farmers , are not going to be allowed to do what they have done in the past .
I am also happy to have chaired the two trialogues that helped to clarify the points to be debated and resolved .
Johannesburg created the momentum for more effective implementation of the agenda on sustainable development .
you are listed as a speaker later in the debate .
we , on this side of the House , consider that it is unnecessary and the first part of the amendment could be misinterpreted , but we would like to support the second part , which stresses the importance of Russia ratifying the Energy Charter .
the European Investment Bank has given specific priority to its financing operations in Central and Eastern European countries in a series of lines and activities .
perhaps it might be worth considering the possibility of giving other Members the floor in the right order .
the European Union has set itself millennium objectives .
it is important to emphasise that , in the new working world which is emerging , safeguarding mutual trust on all sides is the key to increasing productivity .
if he thinks that is so , I ask him to put before us a table comparing the prices in the European Union &apos;s Member States , from which he would see that Greece &apos;s charges are among the lowest in Europe .
he would not have been interrupted by you .
obviously , they should not present a health risk .
accession to Schengen by Sweden would threaten the Nordic passport union and establish new borders with the Baltic states , Eastern Europe and the rest of the world .
as members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , we have voted , together with our fellow party members , for and against a range of amendments . we have done so because we want European development to move in a characteristically social democratic direction .
it is important to thrash out the rights of the host country and the obligations of the home country .
Parliament has appointed a Permanent Rapporteur for Humanitarian Aid , and we congratulate it on that .
we must reinforce solidarity among the Member States and equip ourselves with the appropriate resources to effectively control the external borders .
we agree that there are real problems in this area .
her many years of work have reached an important milestone today .
we should behave outside European waters in just the same way as we do at home .
my country , Lithuania , is a case in point .
the resolution upon which Parliament is about to vote calls upon the Council and the Commission to consider whether collective punishments and the disproportionate use of force are not in conflict with the principles of the Association Agreement and to take the necessary action : our aim is not to punish , just to obtain respect for the rule of law .
like many members of this House I have received powerful representations from local authorities in my own constituency in Scotland , saying that if this directive is not carried local authorities and other public bodies will continue to have to deal , out of general tax revenues , with the problems which other people ought either to have prevented in the first place or be dealing with at present .
case experience , both in the EU and in the US , shows that patent ambush can be a real problem by preventing industry from making an informed choice on the potential costs of the technologies chosen in the standard .
Mr Pirker says it would just be a unit in support of national border guards and not a supranational body replacing them , but some Commission documents suggest that the ultimate aim is indeed some sort of supranational force with power over national authorities .
the United States is threatening no longer to allow aircraft to land , and none of the European Union &apos;s institutions has the backbone to say that , in all good faith , we shall not allow ourselves to be treated like that .
furthermore , I am also of the opinion that the chairman of the Convention should be elected by the Convention itself .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as shadow rapporteur for the seventh framework programme and rapporteur for the ‘ People ’ specific programme , it is my duty first of all to thank Mr Buzek and all the Members with whom we undertook this difficult work in the knowledge that it had to be done quickly and well , even without any prospect of agreement on the financial perspective .
that figure is now 6 million and rising .
on 14 February , Spain also officially asked the Commission to check if the import ban was compatible with the WTO agreement and , if necessary , to file an objection in Geneva .
the next item is Question Time ( B6-0227 / 09 ) .
we are obviously in favour of increasing research funding , but the reasoning in this report becomes unacceptable when it comes to what this increase should be directed towards .
the struggle of the Ogoni people in Nigeria is symbolic of one of the main conditions for World Bank participation , that is the guaranteeing of the right of the indigenous peoples , without coercion and properly informed , to assent in advance to projects that are funded by the World Bank .
I have confidence , however , in the direction the European Union has taken historically , which is unequivocally in favour of diversity with solidarity , in contrast with the uniform approach of the Jacobin States that today prevails in the State of which I am a citizen .
report ( A5-0306 / 2001 ) by Mrs Peijs , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission Communication on the contribution of public finances to growth and employment : improving quality and sustainability ( COM ( 2000 ) 846 - C5-0172 / 2001 - 2001 / 2082 ( COS ) )
lobbying and closed doors are a dangerous mixture , whilst openness and lobbying from different quarters is a basis for well thought-out legislation .
the system proposed by the Commission does not alter these matters .
Frontex coordinates those activities .
that is why my delegation and I endorse all the motions aimed at securing a broader basis for this debate .
I would like to point out that we have also talked about this during Barack Obama &apos;s Presidency , and so it seems this problem is not something we can attribute exclusively to the dreadful and evil administration of George Bush junior .
they did not , therefore , vote for the places to which they had been expelled , but for their places of origin .
we need to reduce that dependency , we need to develop our indigenous resources and , as I have already mentioned , improve our efficiency .
is Parliament not aware that this Whatelet has since , in a political appointment , been elevated to the lordly status of a judge at the Court of Justice and is now washing his hands à la Pontius Pilate ?
public development aid must be increased as a matter of urgency .
Mr Marinos , if the President-in-Office of the Council wishes to reply to you in some way , I have no objection .
the French President has promised the Finance Ministers of the eurozone and the President of the European Central Bank and of the Commission that he is going to promote a very serious programme of reforms which he will set out in detail between now and September .
I come from a country where there are major population centres alongside coastal zones , and those population centres have finally destroyed the quality of the coastal zones , resulting in numerous cases of degradation caused by human activity .
if appropriate , the adoption of the necessary provisions should be proposed .
the country has taken a step towards European democracy .
like any family , we will have arguments and differences .
amendment of Rule 181 on verbatim reports and Rule 182 on audiovisual record of proceedings (
the ruins of the homeland are safe .
the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania ( DAHR ) takes the view that Romania should recognise Kosovo &apos;s independence as soon as possible .
the real issue is appropriate levels of development financing .
none of the plaintiffs therefore attended .
has the Council taken any relevant precautions to integrate workers accordingly ?
it goes without saying that citizens must , in any event , be fully informed .
one effect of this , which is already becoming apparent at local budgetary level , is that small local authorities find it increasingly difficult to raise the complementary resources for EU projects , even if national and regional resources are of course contributed as a matter of course .
I would point out that this agreement comes a little late considering the thousands of signatures we have had the honour of presenting to you on this issue , and considering the growth of this phenomenon which has struck down so many thousands of children , as it did recently in Italy .
it is particularly important in relation to the Financial Perspective for the period commencing 2007 .
many Members have mentioned the difficulties which Europe faces in relation to the Helms-Burton legislation .
there has been significant saving of appropriations .
they will also , therefore , be able to contribute to discussing and presenting relevant measures to correct the faults of the financial system that led to the current situation , making an important contribution to preparing for the possible adoption of properly justified and better legislation in the future .
this opinion fits in with a fashion trend which has led to a neo-liberal stampede against public services , public companies and organised employees , especially in the sectors of postal services , rail and energy supply .
Mr President , the way the voting went this morning reinforced our bitter feeling that the draft European Constitution flouts fundamental social desires and mounts a serious challenge to the European social model .
a brief word on priorities in e-learning and employment policy as they affect small and medium-sized enterprises .
this is why I expect concerted European activity with a strong international component .
for that reason I agree the proposals before us .
Mr President , as the chairperson of the European Parliament Intergroup on wine : tradition and Quality , I am obviously especially pleased that information provision and promotional activities in favour of agricultural products may also now apply to quality wine-growing products .
it has nothing to do with the Minutes either , although I am delighted to hear it .
we are backing you , Mr Orbán , and we are cheering you on , because that means cheering Hungary on and cheering Europe on as a whole .
the people who are asking us to close off access to the Internet are importing into Europe music produced elsewhere .
in addition to that , the contribution of aviation to our failure to achieve the Kyoto target is still massive .
the first aspect is the importance of the legislative process within the European Union .
contrary to Mr Evans &apos;s report , which , despite certain positive aspects , is still too timid in its approach , I believe the right of asylum should be absolute and unquestionable .
that , I believe , is extremely important if we are to be able to move ahead as a successful society .
an institution which leaves such an impression on people is no longer up to date ; change is required .
first of all I would say in reply to Mr Sjöstedt &apos;s question that the European Council in Madrid fixed the starting date for the third stage at 1 January 1999 .
if the Member States provide evidence that certain elements within the seven directives are still necessary , for example , on consumer protection grounds , such as provisions from the directive relating to tyre pressure gauges for motor vehicles , these sections will be incorporated into the Framework measuring instruments Directive .
overall , the total of EUR 870 billion at which we have arrived , that is around 1.06 % of the European Union ’ s gross national income , is close to the figures that have been discussed .
with these qualifications , as we certainly do not want to adopt the American situation here overnight , more mobility for employees and young people is a goal of ours .
it is certainly true that the presence of DHA in breast milk has a positive impact on the visual development of infants up to 12 months .
do not place the EFSA in any building or venue that has close connections with the institutions of the European Union .
the location of the Foreign Service is therefore a crucial issue .
without making a parallel between the Soviet Union and present-day Russia , I want to say that what I heard from Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mrs Malmström is gratifying because it continues this policy of pragmatic partnership with Russia , highlighting that there are issues where the European Union cannot achieve success without the involvement of Russia .
it is , of course , too early to comment on this recent round of talks , but we hope that both sides will proceed in a constructive manner .
this will have the effect of undermining the principles of equality , universality and social cohesion and , most importantly , the possibility of upholding fundamental human rights in practice .
this is not what we are debating .
import bans , though , should be a last line of defence .
I also think it is important to establish that each Member State has a perfect right to examine each asylum application itself .
in the programme we emphasised that patient safety is an important area .
Iran , for its part , must suspend any activity designed to obtain nuclear material for military purposes ; it must do so because it has signed the non-proliferation Treaty , thus also undertaking to apply its Additional Protocol .
we want the European Union to intervene more actively in this area and to step up its involvement in assisting these countries in their reform processes .
the fact is , however , that until the institutional issue is resolved , this doubt is always present and , particularly when we are outside Europe , we are confronted with questions to which we have to attach due prominence .
it is important to insist that the Commission draw up a proposal for a common list of additives by the end of 2004 at the latest .
the exchanges of views that we have had here or in committee have given us food for thought as to which strategy should be applied .
in my view , many of the amendments tabled by Members reflect important issues that are not reflected adequately in the Commission proposal .
these are workers who must be safeguarded and protected .
does it mean the USA-style development , where new jobs actually mean jobs which pay salaries that no one can live on , or does it mean dialogue in the labour markets ?
it now seems to be an established practice always to have a special session on human rights and democracy before Christmas .
they asked who should be a player in this regard and whether it was a matter for Europe in the first place and felt that perhaps we should not get too carried in making decisions , and so forth .
he said that the Swedish Government is offending against the internal market and that he intended to take action against the Swedish Government when the case was dealt with by the Court .
nevertheless , we voted in favour of the report as a whole because rejecting it would have led to a great deal of confusion , since we would have been leaving in place a system in which Members &apos; travel expenses are not being claimed on the basis of the genuine costs incurred , which in our opinion they should be .
let me close with a few figures on the volume of next year ’ s general budget .
in conclusion , bearing in mind the incentives we have regarding some of our neighbours such as Ukraine , it is clear that , while we now have the great task of completing this enlargement , we must also open the debate on Europe &apos;s borders , on its roots , on all these issues .
congratulations to everybody today , but I would point out that there will be great resistance if there is any intention to take with one hand tomorrow what is given today with the other .
if the Union in its wisdom would appoint Mr Jarzembowski to be the inspector of TENs superstructures in all the ports of the European Union , that would mean he was gainfully employed , dedicated to the service of the Community .
on average only just under a third of household waste in Europe is recycled or composted .
I got involved in drafting this European Parliament resolution on failures in protection of human rights and justice in the Democratic Republic of Congo based on a desire to find a way of making those responsible for these actions respect civil rights and freedoms , as well as human dignity and the international commitments to which the country is party .
it also has to be said that the way in which the European Union has gone about things there is hardly likely to call forth rapturous enthusiasm about the success of the work it does .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the excellent own-initiative report by my Austrian colleague Richard Seeber in response to the communication by the European Commission entitled &apos; addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union &apos; .
but can we , in such a situation , talk of the legitimacy of the elected government ?
the euro is now a reality that is becoming more and more concrete every day , but that does not mean we can regard it without particular apprehension and attention .
the Bureau has proposed a figure of 20.46 % - in other words , EUR 39 million above the figure for 2010 .
why has the United Nations Security Council failed to reinforce this demand with a mandatory resolution under Chapter VII ?
to coordinate the aid from countries more effectively , to ensure our aid is more efficient , to speak with a European voice that is identifiable in the world and to live up to the world &apos;s expectations of us at such times : to support this humanitarian crisis and promote development .
this directive is worthy of our approval .
we suggested that , considering the original proposal , we could envisage launching the programme even with EUR 100 million rather than EUR 150 million .
I greet such signs of determination with pleasure .
cohesion policies , the Structural Funds and regional policies are , and will , remain a crucial element of the European project .
in 1991 we had to borrow IEP760 million to keep public services going .
instead of protecting the lives and rights of citizens , the president , the prime minister , the prosecurot &apos;s office , the Ministry of Interior and the Sofia mayor have merged into a symbiotic entity and are using the levers of power solely for political recketeering of those who disagree with them .
the Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee - I cannot quite believe we had to fight for that , but still - and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain tasks .
since that day there has been no talk about making European agriculture competitive , but I want to thank Mr Fischler for continuing with that theme and at least putting forward the aspiration that European agriculture can take its place in the world and take its share of world markets .
I hope we will be able to improve dialogue and cooperation between all those concerned in order to secure a sustainable future for our industry .
as the rapporteur maintains , this proposal for a regulation is a step towards more comprehensive environmental accounting .
at the moment , it is important that each state adopts this measure , as otherwise there is the risk of causing panic among the population .
I support enlargement and strengthening , and I am against agreeing to give up on strengthening .
women &apos;s rights are human rights .
. ( PT ) I wish to congratulate Mrs Sudre on her report , which concerns extending exemption arrangements for dock dues , authorising partial or total exemption from this tax for local production in the French overseas departments .
given that Community legislation does not apply in third countries , it is currently not possible to ensure that airports in third countries or non-Community air carriers have security requirements that are equivalent to those applied within the European Union and the European Economic Area .
I hope you will be able to endorse Amendment No 22 , nevertheless .
standards certainly need to be developed for an international system of certification .
after all , what honour is there in sentencing a simple minister of Beijing house church to do forced labour ? for three years he had to spend ten to twelve hours a day making footballs for the upcoming Olympic Games .
we will pay attention to this and connect that with labour market trends .
then Chancellor Merkel ensured that EU-Mediterranean relations would be developed further within the existing EU structures .
Central banks , including the ECB , have to a great extent been effective in identifying the weaknesses and risks to the financial system that materialised as the turmoil unfolded .
it also emphasises the important public goods which farmers produce , often with little or no recognition .
to conclude , we must not lose sight of eliminating the digital divide , even in the midst of economic crisis .
( El ) Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your detailed reply .
every one of us can do something too .
it introduces limitations on the fishing effort , allocated to the Member States in proportion to their share in the total allowable catch of cod .
I ask Members of this Parliament , where do you stand on this issue ?
we can show what has been done .
she did a very good job , as of course , did Mr Grosch , of whom Parliament has come to expect good reports .
we also have an EU that is buying buildings around Europe in the belief that it is cheaper .
what incentive for reform is left , after all , when the pressure is taken off , if it is guaranteed that accession is going to go ahead anyway ?
the EU , for its part , has suggested a 25 % reduction in the number of people living in poverty by 2020 and an allocation of 0.7 % of gross national income to development aid .
we therefore have plenty of excellent opportunities , but also plenty of problem areas where cooperation has to be continued .
these days , the refugees from Abkhazia are putting the thumbscrews on Georgian authorities to secure their return home .
I voted wrongly on the conclusion to section 23 .
these are very conservative estimates .
people should not live in small or big prisons for their thoughts .
( HU ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as my fellow Member , Mr Marinescu , has already pointed out , the volcanic ash crisis demonstrated that Europe was neither strategically nor technologically prepared for this situation .
can they do it ?
I am very positive that we are on the right route and I believe that what Parliament has put forward has helped to strengthen the methodology , also scrutinising the approach which will be involved in this particular battle .
I think that , overall , despite certain attempts in the area of competition , the basic rules have not changed .
it would do Russia credit to put this on the agenda , so that these human problems can be solved .
while road haulage companies will now have to pay the cost of air and noise pollution generated by lorries , Member States will , in return , be obliged to reinvest the revenues obtained from these charges in pan-European transport networks and , especially , in more effective and less polluting transport systems .
it is destined to be incorporated in to the Treaties and the Commission thinks this should be fully realised as part of the reorganisation of the treaties we proposed at the Intergovernmental Conference , which we hope the European Council will be able to approve in Nice .
speaking of the implementation period for the Regulation , it is projected to be unjustifiably long .
two declarations were attached to that amendment :
no other country has ever dared so coarsely and provocatively to ridicule its own promises , disregard its commitments , make fools of governments on both sides of the Atlantic in so short a time , show such shamelessness in violating human rights inside and outside its own domain , and use even dark methods - including murder - to promote its own shady interests .
at present there is a conflict between the Board of the shipyard and the European Commission , which is demanding a drastic reduction in the shipyard &apos;s capacity and the closure of two slipways , or else the refund of state aid .
this should bring us one step closer to a more sustainable transport system .
things are not running quite as smoothly as we imagine them to be there either .
where there are no forests , then we can grow willows and miscanthus to make sure that we can produce energy supply .
we are told that the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaties , which would render it binding at European level , would not give the Union any additional competences .
when we discuss and even criticise the efforts of the United States to eradicate tyranny and support democracy in Iraq and elsewhere , we must not ignore the games of Russia and China in the region , which may easily end up transforming the region into a burning crater of global terrorist war .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I would like to welcome you here to the European Parliament .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , women have always had an important role in the agricultural and rural sector .
however , it eventually decided that the revised text did not involve harmonisation procedures , which are covered by Article 100A . as a result , the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights agrees entirely that Article 235 provides an appropriate legal base .
incidentally , this week , we are also proposing a new European mechanism for financial stability .
also , the peace settlement does not apply to west Darfur , since Arab nomads and solders have driven out most of the black population to neighbouring Chad .
I take up your invitation Mr President and I should look forward to the visit very much .
let me address the two issues on our agenda today one after the other .
we must therefore concentrate on a thorough analysis and examination of current trends , focusing on using new rules to restrict those technologies and those possibilities which violate the privacy of families and the privacy of children , and which damage the healthy development of the family , and we must apply these rules consistently .
however , having said that , our group will not be able to support this report in tomorrow &apos;s vote , partly indeed because of this presumption that trade in services is essentially exactly the same as trade in goods .
all in all , it is the Commission &apos; s intention to transfer more responsibility to the Member States in the customs field .
the Commission understands the concerns that have motivated the request for a split vote , but feels that the current text addresses these concerns sufficiently .
now , five years later , we see that the new Commission has chosen to ignore all of these findings that are so important to our survival .
it is difficult to explain to the European public why , for example , the Prince of Monaco or large multinationals such as Heineken and Nestlé receive hundreds of thousands of euros in income support in the form of agricultural subsidies merely because they own some land , whilst real farmers often struggle to make ends meet .
these elections were about encouraging politicians to follow the instructions and recommendations of the military , the &apos; new &apos; allies of imperialism in the region .
are there any comments ?
I am delighted that all but one of my amendments were accepted in committee , but I would like to point out that the text in recital K is not quite correct .
this proposal confines itself to merely codifying the existing texts , without any change in their substance .
the vision that the Commission has just outlined , of a more socially orientated Europe in the 21st century , is conceptually flawless but bereft of any actual legislative initiative .
opposition to this Treaty is mainly from the far right and some on the extreme left of this House .
a re-evaluation of the additives should therefore be carried out every ten years , taking account of new scientific information and research data .
we need concrete progress in important areas , of which I will cite just a few .
yet these people cannot be reached in the tried and true manner , directly through the traditional networks of commercial banks , because these target groups are suspicious of the above instruments , and as already mentioned , they are not able to enter the free market .
( I am proud to have be granted the opportunity to serve the people of Connaught-Ulster , Ireland .
in this connection , however , we have to view new benefits for Members with some reservations .
we have also renewed our support for a free Internet by condemning Internet censorship and the threats that it poses to human rights , as well as to access to and sharing of global cultural heritage .
my report deals with this regulation and , as has been said , it concerns a key mechanism in the implementation of the European Union &apos;s goal of free movement of people in that it coordinates social security systems .
it is time that our Parliament blew the whistle to bring an end to this little game .
we know they are true from our experience .
I can therefore only warn the Commission not to take these steps .
the gunmen tied him and his wife to a chair and , as she pleaded for their lives , the Brigade member told her : &apos; his time has come &apos; .
however , as many speakers have said , despite what the Council may say about the importance of education and despite the Commission &apos;s good faith regarding lifelong learning , there is a lack of commitment on financial resources .
the goals have been set of reducing the school drop-out rate to below 10 % and enabling 40 % of young people to complete higher education by 2020 .
after rice , wheat and maize , bananas are the world &apos;s fourth most important food crop .
what specious reasoning we are hearing from the well-meaning , open-minded Left , however !
Mr President , on behalf of my group I should like to congratulate Mrs RothBehrendt .
although the Dutch policy of tolerance is at least pragmatic , this proposal by the Council is also completely absurd in practice , since it is impossible to govern with amounts written in stone .
far from being innocent , this report is dangerous for the freedoms and rights of the people .
in this context , however , we must not overlook the various initiatives to pave the way for so-called giga- or megaliners , which are associated with high infrastructure costs .
with EUR 425 million less ?
in order to restore the citizens &apos; confidence in Europe , we must make the institutions of this Convention more transparent , more efficient and more democratic .
in fact , it complicates the Transatlantic Alliance , produces no additional troops and has no real purpose , except to shift defence and security decision-making responsibilities away from NATO headquarters - where European countries sit around the same table as our American allies - to the European Union , from which Americans are specifically excluded .
it did not have a legal basis because the Commission should have presented to Parliament an evaluation of the measures financed by the Community under this line as far back as October 2000 and proposed a new regulation .
the first concerns the European Investment Bank .
we must support this compromise which was accepted by 72 % of the committee .
we did not witness such barbarity even in the darkest Middle Ages .
as we have just seen in the debate on Ireland , certain countries must not be allowed to set lower tax rates in order to attract businesses and then , when they get into financial difficulties , to call on other countries to finance their budget deficits , if I can put this in such a simplistic way .
I therefore have another question to put to both the Commission and the Council .
in the area of funding , the report encourages the use of Structural Funds in support of energy efficiency , and calls for this to be made a priority within the EU budget after 2013 .
these proposals are downright unfair , to say the very least .
this is not about organising parties according to a single , standardised structure , but about following a more general model .
its acceptance by the majority of the House will depend on the adoption of important amendments .
secondly , I would like to mention that our committee wishes to maintain all its amendments at this stage , especially those relating to Eurostat .
we see from the supplementary and amending budget that the agreements we reached with the Commission are simply not being applied .
but the bearing of arms is also subject to restrictions , and these restrictions are exceeded in the US plans , which have now been leaked , concerning the use of nuclear weapons .
our proposal will also make the law enforcement process more manageable by facilitating access to information .
Mr President , I do not think that any of us here are contesting whether or not there should be an ivory trade : of course there should not .
I shall end with a particularly important issue raised , that of consumer information .
should we not be setting the cost of disposing of animal by-products against what it will cost European farmers if there is a renewed outbreak of BSE in their herds or - worse still - if people start falling ill ?
my second point is that Europe must finally provide itself with the instruments necessary to retain or recover production capacity , for example industrial or agricultural production capacity , and to retain - and this is absolutely vital for its future - its technological progress .
the PPE-DE Group is putting forward its own resolution and is not able to support the resolution by the other political groups , which emphasise widening the campaign to include anti-tank mines and other categories of munitions .
the euro , of course , limited the potential for &apos; stray &apos; capital to speculate on exchange rates .
in modifying the existing common consular instructions , it provides firstly for the obligation to supply biometrics which will be stored in the vis and the standards for doing so , but secondly it includes provisions on the organisation of receiving visa applications .
let there be no mistake about it .
I would like to welcome the host of issues raised by this report , which has enabled us , regardless of the committee we are working in , to find a series of correlations which need to be achieved so that we make a greater contribution to achieving the EU 2020 targets .
on the contrary , I believe that , in many areas , we have succeeded in making progress and finding compromises that are acceptable to everyone .
we do not wish to see agricultural policies returned to national control , or appropriations for the Structural Funds remaining unaltered , with the same amount of money being distributed between a greater number of countries .
in another important aspect of our north-south cooperation , however , we must try to encourage the cultivation of alternative crops to get off the ground .
such success was not self-evident .
with regard to the impact of Basel III on both major and smaller banks , generally speaking , we will proceed very carefully with macro- and micro-economic impact studies , without improvising , and I will use all flexibility margins in order to develop good measures and good decisions that are as well-gauged as possible .
indeed , we need a strong impetus , expertise and a decision timetable which the European Central Bank could draw up and which the Council of Ministers for the euro area , presided by your good self , Mr Juncker , could then adopt and implement .
( BG ) Thank you , Mr President .
furthermore , around 900 million people are chronically hungry due to extreme poverty , while up to 2 billion people lack genuine , long-term food security due to varying degrees of poverty .
in turn , defence is constantly changing its boundaries in a world in which the perception of these is ever more blurred : nowadays , we cannot only consider the territorial defence of one State faced with a possible attack by another , but rather , as has been correctly said , we have armies that lack clear enemies and enemies that lack armies .
in the calendar proposed , there is a reference to the date of the elections in 2009 .
I have my own thoughts for you also .
the Commission appreciates that citizens and workers need to feel secure in this difficult time .
it would be wrong to oppose the directive because it does not give sufficient rights of information and consultation .
that is why I voted for the report on the European Joint undertaking for ITER and the Development of fusion Energy .
for example , one achievement is that all of the excessive deficits in the euro area have been corrected .
I would therefore like to ask the European Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of money spent on the fight against HIV / AIDS .
( heckling )
the main legal problem arises when the public authority continues to deny all the other companies the opportunity to provide those services in the same area , in a situation of transparent and honest competition .
we must not treat it like a commercial item and operate a policy under which the biggest business is the purchase of agricultural land and its alienation from agricultural production for other purposes .
whereas a few years ago it was predicted that by 1998 there would be three million users in Europe , when 1998 came we realised that there were already 18 million , and this growth is still continuing .
by voting through this amendment now as part of Amendment No 188 , Parliament would make clear that such Member States could not expect the benefits of hosting such new agencies if they are not prepared to exercise their responsibilities .
it should be pointed out that the Commission has accepted such withdrawals in the past and has consequently terminated investigations without taking measures .
someone said that the guilty parties should be condemned ; well , you will be dining with one of them tonight - with President Putin himself .
Chancellor Gordon Brown was asked how much funding was to be allocated to the military action and his answer was &apos; as much as it takes &apos; .
the future we desire will come about through fundamental technological development , as well as through actions that we can all carry out , starting today .
well , I believe a reference to the founding values of Europe , an explicit reference to Christian values , would be a contribution to our history .
the factual evidence on PR suggests that , bearing in mind the spoilt ballot papers that remain in each Member State that has PR , large numbers of voters reject it at every election .
( RO ) Given that energy efficiency is one of the priority areas for the EU &apos;s economic recovery and for combating climate change , I feel that it is necessary to set up a European fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy to raise the public and private funds for implementing specific projects across the European Union . this would provide a model of efficiency for using European public money .
it is therefore important to take advantage of the possibilities for peaceful and constructive exchanges of views as part of a process of dialogue within ACP regions and countries involving government and civil society .
we must therefore spread this kind of awareness-raising initiative in order to combat discriminatory attitudes and to ensure that the citizens are kept informed about their rights and obligations .
there are only a few of us left now , this being the third reading .
I have returned from Porto Alegre , and I can tell you that the Brazilians and Argentinians whom I met there admit that they have been doing the same thing in various places , namely feeding animal carcasses to cattle .
the initial amendment was apparently mistranslated into German to mean exactly the opposite of what the English said because the English text was ambiguous .
I would like to ask the representative of the Council what you think of paragraphs 15 and 16 of the report by Mr Tsatsos and Mr Méndez de Vigo . and I would like to ask the representative of the Council to repeat what your Prime Minister , Mr Juncker , said .
the purpose of the treaty change is very specific .
this means our Parliament runs the risk of being dominated , not by the PPE-DE Group or by the Socialist Group , but by AKP Islamists .
Madam President , Commissioner , the great interest which you have witnessed in this House today - even though you yourself are not responsible for fisheries - has , I hope , made it clear how much our ideas deserve support , both in the Committee on Fisheries and in the Commission .
as regards aviation , the study was brought to completion in 2004 .
we are just about to do this , and I count on you to enable us to do it in the course of June , before the summer break .
for the moment we must make a virtue of necessity and live with the existing rules .
the question of earmarking , mentioned by a number of Members this morning , was discussed at last week &apos;s trialogue .
it goes without saying that Arafat is the one who risks the most and the responsibility of a definitive collapse of this peace process would inevitably end up benefiting those who believe in religious extremism , fundamentalism ; it would thus sweep aside those who have worked for peace , beginning with Arafat himself .
if you look around , how could we find a perfect document ?
