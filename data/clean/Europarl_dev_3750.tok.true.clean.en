only in this way can obscure and illegal practices be traced and penalised more easily because - and this appears to me to be the key problem - the discrepancy between the legal and illegal arms trade is becoming increasingly smaller .
the globalisation of world trade makes arms cheaper , more readily available and more difficult to trace .
according to Oxfam , fifty-five percent of the total trade in light weapons is illegal .
needless to say , a stricter code of conduct only makes sense if the Member States assume their own share of the responsibility .
in certain air- and seaports , arms control leaves a great deal to be desired .
in addition , cooperation with candidate countries must be stepped up in this area .
they may subscribe to the code , but in certain cases act as the hub of the illegal arms trade .
some will claim that the code of conduct is not ambitious enough , but it is better to have a code of conduct which is flawed than not to have one at all .
in any event , future annual reports should contain more complete and transparent information , and the code of conduct should become legally binding in due course .
this code of conduct is a first step in the direction of greater coherence , but I share the rapporteur &apos; s hope that we will not leave it at that .
Mr President , the real solution to the whole problem of arms exports and arms production is that we should convert to non-weapons production .
we are in the 21st century now .
the technology and expertise that is available should be used for something constructive in society , something that will benefit people rather than something that is going to annihilate and destroy people .
we should be focusing on the conversion to non-weapons production instead of on how we will compete with the other weapons manufacturing countries around the world .
countries with very few resources and very little money are coerced and forced into buying weapons when they should be using that money for social and health problems in their own countries instead of contributing to insecurity in the region and in many cases to the abuse of their own people with these weapons .
we only have to look at Indonesia and the fact that the European Union could not wait to lift the arms embargo , or to not reinstate it .
that was deplorable .
if you look at the other countries in Europe which are now getting involved in the arms industry it is extremely disturbing .
I come from Ireland , which has a track record of non-weapons production and no involvement in the arms industry .
now I find that contracts for arms and components for arms are increasing every year .
in Northern Ireland , where there is a so-called peace process one of the big companies that has come there and been welcomed with open arms is Raytheon one of the biggest arms manufacturers in the world .
that is a complete contradiction in terms .
we should tackle this .
we should keep the arms industries out .
that is not where we should be providing jobs .
we should be providing jobs for people in something that is constructive and positive for society .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fact that we are debating the code of conduct is a positive step .
nonetheless , several legitimate questions arise .
is it possible for those who used their weapons in Yugoslavia to murder civilians , destroy buildings and bridges , and cause irreparable destruction to the environment , and those who murdered , and continue to murder , children in Iraq , to be really interested in arms control ?
is it possible for those who acknowledge that the European arms industry is important both economically and strategically to be sincere when they say that the external actions of the European Union must be inspired by the values of democracy and the protection of human rights ?
rather , as has already been said , they are far more concerned that their weapons will end up in the wrong hands , or that their acts of aggression will accept enemy fire from weapons they have made themselves .
but the weapons are already in the wrong hands , and we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that procedures such as the code of conduct could put a stop to the acts of aggression and crimes of the new order of things .
we are convinced that the existence of the code of conduct is not the result of the philanthropic feelings of those who inspired it , but of the intensified resistance of people against the barbarity of imperialism .
we place our hopes for a world without conflict and weapons in the universal , peaceful and , more generally , popular movement .
Mr President , special attention deserves to be paid to the European Parliament &apos; s first report on the export of arms since the Member States adopted a Code of Conduct on this matter in 1998 .
if the European Union &apos; s action beyond its borders is to be coherent in the way that the European Parliament never tires of asking that it should be , must not the priority of the arms-exporting States , in a sphere ultra-sensitive to public opinion , be that of simultaneously paying attention to human rights , conflict prevention and the European Union &apos; s external security ?
our rapporteur , Mr Titley , is proposing a bold resolution to Parliament .
he emphasises the entirely inadequate nature of the code of conduct which , it should be remembered , is non-binding .
the code ought therefore to be made legally binding .
controls must be tightened up , and the ultimate use to which exported arms are put must be strictly monitored In a word , the trade in death must stop .
the supervisory mechanism must above all be extended to the light , small calibre arms used in a great many regional and ethnic conflicts throughout the world , which are often turned against the civil and military personnel of EU countries .
finally , Mr Titley proposes cooperating with the United States - and why not , I might add , with Russia and China too ? - in order to devise a common approach to conventional arms export controls similar to that established for chemical weapons control .
the five permanent members of the Security Council , who are supposed to watch over our security , should listen to these proposals and negotiate an arrangement truly worthy of the twenty-first century as quickly as possible .
Mr President , I fully share the hope and the opinion of Mrs Morgantini and Mr Brie , whose first amendment clearly states that the Union &apos; s aim must not merely be to establish a code of conduct on arms exports , but to work for international disarmament and to end the arms race altogether .
this should be the European Union &apos; s fundamental objective .
whatever the case , arms exports exist and it is therefore useful and it is a step forward to have a code of conduct on arms exports , which sometimes run counter to the principles that should be the identifying features of the European Union : conflict prevention and the defence of human rights .
we should therefore take this opportunity to make the code more efficient and to ensure that our young soldiers engaged in peace missions do not have to confront , as they occasionally do , arms exported by the European Union .
there are four issues which we should examine thoroughly .
Mr President , I believe that the Titley report and the code of conduct , which we are debating together today , are two initial steps in the right direction . of course , we must regard them as just a starting-point .
I would like to make a few general points , which I think may contribute to the debate .
the arms trade is characterised by the fact that the major purchasers are poor countries , which seem to be able to find the money for arms but not for anything else .
this should trouble us , since the money comes from smuggling , from the sale of drugs and from a compliant banking system . but the sale of weapons is often made easier by the dealers themselves .
I believe that it is not enough for us to seek out the end user .
we must seek out the producers , who must be made to defend themselves and to explain what they have done with their entire weapons production , because usually weapons smuggling starts with the producer and not with any other sector .
I would like to add that , in addition to the countries of the European Union , all the countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe that have close ties with the EU , Cyprus , Canada and others have contributed to this positive development .
we cannot take practical decisions based on false information and distorted realities .
this relates to the specific statement made about Turkey &apos; s behaviour in this regard .
Mr President , I do not know whether to laugh or to recoil in horror at this report .
if it were adopted , it would show up the European Parliament for what it is and for what it is good for .
the report even has the temerity to present arms exports as a means of preventing conflicts , combating poverty and promoting human rights .
the weapon used to target and kill a Palestinian child in cold blood is no doubt a product of the duly regulated , ethical arms trade , as no doubt were the bombs dropped upon the former Yugoslavia and the fragmentation mines left in Africa .
given that armaments are the flagship product of international trade and a huge source of profit for a number of large industrial groups which like to think they are respectable , the only role left to the European Parliament is that of attaching the fig leaf of hypocrisy to the traffic in arms and the loathsome state of affairs which enables it to thrive .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
separating financial control functions
Mr President , I am pleased to see so many members of the public here today because , as everyone up there can see , there are very few people down here at this time of night .
today &apos;s debate marks an important step in the reform process that was initiated by the Prodi Commission just over one year ago .
it is the very first legislative proposal to be considered by this House as part of the reform package .
the proposal to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function flows directly from the recommendations formulated last year by the Committee of Independent Experts , which Parliament endorsed in my report of 19 January of this year .
this draft legislation is more important to the future of the Commission than its less than thrilling title suggests .
in its first report the Committee of Independent Experts stated that internal control and internal audit were entirely separate - even conflicting - activities , which do not belong in the same department .
they reached the conclusion that a priori control and internal auditing are activities which employ completely different techniques and address completely different concerns .
the arrangement whereby they have been kept together within the same DG should be reviewed .
internal auditing must play an effective supporting role in the service of the Commission so that the latter can exercise its responsibilities .
with that aim in view , the human resources allocated to internal auditing should be greatly increased .
in addition , internal auditing must take its place independently .
the Court of Auditors took the same view in 1997 , when it wrote that there was a latent conflict between the power to grant approval - and thus expenditure - and the responsibility for subsequently evaluating the same expenditure in accordance with the criteria for sound financial management .
the Commission &apos;s fast-track proposal seeks to implement the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts by creating an internal auditor who operates separately and independently from the financial controller .
I have no doubt that its implementation will be one of the keys to the success of the reform package announced by Vice-President Kinnock in April .
I am proud of the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control has been able to agree unanimously on a draft opinion within a very short period of time .
many thanks , therefore , to the other members of the committee for their help and in particular to Mr dell &apos;Alba , whose work as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets proved invaluable .
let us hope that the Council will now take a leaf out of our book and develop the same sense of urgency .
while our committee welcomes the broad gist of the Commission &apos;s proposal , my report presents a number of changes which must be made in order to make the proposed separation of powers work .
I cannot help but feel that in the race to produce a proposal within the time limit set by the Reform White Paper , the Commission failed to focus properly on the detail .
the changes proposed by our committee are designed to clarify the Commission &apos;s text , to impose certain minimum reporting standards and to tailor the text more closely to the specific circumstances of the different European institutions , all of which are affected by any changes to the Financial Regulation .
first , the division of responsibilities between the financial controller and the new internal auditor must be clarified .
it is not enough to state that an internal auditor must be appointed .
the Financial Regulation must also contain a job description .
our committee &apos;s amendments seek to draw a clear distinction between the role of the financial controller who remains responsible for ex ante financial control , and the internal auditor , who is responsible for ex post control , and in particular reporting on the quality of management and control systems .
secondly , the Commission &apos;s proposal would have the effect of making the appointment of an internal auditor compulsory for all institutions .
while this makes sense for an institution with a large operational budget or those with a relatively large administrative budget , such as the European Parliament and the Council , it does not necessarily make sense for the other small institutions which have a financial control staff of no more than four .
while these institutions must have the option of appointing an internal auditor , it is sufficient to impose certain minimum audit requirements on the financial controller .
it must be clear , however , that this distinction can only apply during a transitional period .
when the recasting of the Financial Regulation is completed , hopefully within one to two years , it must apply fully to all institutions .
some members of the committee have argued that the appointment of an internal auditor should be made compulsory for all institutions at this stage .
of course such a notion has superficial appeal , but if it leads to the appointment of at least 20 additional officials without a clear prospect of direct efficiency gains it should be resisted .
it is important , however , that institutions which do not employ an internal auditor take the job of internal audit seriously .
I was surprised to discover that in at least one of the smaller institutions no audits were carried out by the financial controller despite the clear requirement to do so in the Financial Regulation .
the third change to the Commission &apos;s proposals contained in my report is therefore the spelling out of a minimum reporting requirement .
one of the problems Parliament has faced in recent years is a lack of standardised information on financial control from the institutions .
I therefore propose that both the financial controller and the internal auditor should produce annual reports detailing their activities .
finally , institutions must learn from each other instead of constantly reinventing the wheel .
my report proposes that the annual internal audit report produced in one institution should be made available to all other institutions to enable them where appropriate to apply the conclusions arrived at elsewhere to their own management and control systems .
as I have already reminded the House , this proposal is only the prelude to a full recasting of the Financial Regulation .
Parliament has not yet received the official text of the proposal but we have been able to see a preliminary version of the text and although I hope the full text will be forwarded to Parliament soon I also understand the Commission &apos;s wish to ensure that the text is legally and linguistically watertight .
it is a very substantial document .
some in Parliament have already referred to it as the &quot; beast &quot; , but it is going to be one of the most important items of legislation before us during the term of this Parliament .
one of the key changes advocated by the Commission is the abolition of the system of ex ante financial control .
this proposal does not meet with unanimous approval in this Parliament as , the Commissioner well knows .
many Members are concerned that the existing system of financial control will disappear before a new system which now exists only on paper has been proven to work .
we have therefore asked the Commission to give us an undertaking that during the transitional period which is about to begin the system of centralised ex ante control will be maintained and will not be affected by the introduction of the internal audit function .
I would ask the Commission to confirm today the undertaking it has already given Parliament in relation to this point .
I would , however , like to make my personal point of view very clear .
I welcome the proposed change in principle .
as the Committee of Independent Experts pointed out last year , most of the irregularities highlighted by the committee stem from decisions approved by the financial controller , that the supposed quality guarantee provided by the approval is a myth and put forward two strong arguments for changing the system .
first , ex ante checking , whether it be universal or based on sampling , is unlikely to be a cost-effective process .
the effort put into checking all transactions is clearly disproportionate , while sampling is unlikely to have sufficient deterrent effect .
the second and fundamental principle is that any retention of ex ante control runs up against the crucial objection that , de facto if not de jure , it displaces responsibility for financial regularity from the person actually managing expenditure to the person approving it .
although the Court of Auditors has never explicitly backed abolition of centralised ex ante financial control and we have yet to hear its views on the proposal at present before us , it has raised the possibility of moving to a different system .
in its 1997 opinion it wrote : &quot; as for completely abolishing the requirement of prior approval , this would not be acceptable unless it were to be replaced by other procedures that provided at least equivalent safeguards and that could also involve financial officials other than the financial controller . &quot;
the Commission &apos;s challenge will be to convince Parliament that it can create those safeguards .
Mr President , this evening , we are discussing the tightening of controls on expenditure by the European institutions . an important topic , I might add , as Europe has a bad reputation among its electorate in this area .
too much European money disappears to unknown destinations , both at Brussels level and within the Member States . the objective of the Commission proposal we are discussing today is to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function .
the Van Hulten report is right to define further the discrepancy put forward by the Commission and sets the right tone for exchanging best practices among institutions .
there might be some reservation with regard to the exception Mr Van Hulten makes in his report for smaller institutions where the appointment of auditors is concerned .
however , I can understand the pragmatic reasoning behind this idea .
I too believe that the staffing levels in those institutions are too low to warrant extra manpower .
I would like to pay special attention to one point in particular , namely the fact that the separation of ex ante control and the audit may not have any bearing on the position of ex ante control .
after all , these are administrative-official institutions where the option of ex ante control remains an absolute necessity .
this does not mean that permission must be gained from the financial director for the purchase of every single pencil .
what it does mean , however , is that an assessment is carried out , according to modern methods on the basis of risk analyses , to find out in what cases of expenditure ex ante control is absolutely essential .
it also means that ex ante control must still be required when the services request this .
if this possibility were not to exist , this could lead to a situation in which people no longer dare take decisions .
also important is that the ex ante control continues to be carried out independently , admittedly in a decentralised manner , but certainly not under the Director-General of the Directorate-General under scrutiny .
in summary , independent audits are compulsory but cannot be carried out without modern and efficient ex ante control . the two are strictly separated but jointly responsible for the sound supervision of the European institutions &apos; expenditure .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Socialist Group in this House supports Mr van Hulten &apos; s report and therefore also the unanimous decision and proposal from the Committee on Budgetary Control .
so - nothing against an independent , internal audit service , to which we are giving the green light today with Mr van Hulten &apos; s report !
a professional audit is an essential component of modern management in the public and private sphere .
however , a good audit is not in itself a miracle cure .
I will not name any names here , but one could give a whole list of companies where renowned auditing firms have attested that all is well , only to find a few weeks or months later that they have collapsed .
that is why I find it worrying that the Commission is obviously still intending , as before , to introduce the new audit service not as a useful complementary service but as a substitute for the traditional financial control .
as previous speakers made clear , that means it is on a head-on collision course with a majority in this Parliament , which after all is responsible for scrutinising and assessing the Commission .
nor , unfortunately , is the independence of the new audit service beyond all doubt .
under the so-called fast-track procedure we are discussing today , the Commission guarantees that independence , but the draft document on the general reform of the Financial Regulation , of which we already have a provisional version , is a step back again in that respect .
why , for instance , Commissioner , does the Commission not want to grant the internal auditor the power to initiate proceedings before the European Court of Justice in the event of his independence being impeded ?
and is the independence of the internal auditor not also impeded if - even before he is appointed - a fait accompli is established by recruiting his staff in advance ?
we have other examples of where that leads .
we need only think of OLAF .
here too the Commission faced the new director with a fait accompli by simply transferring the entire team of the former UCLAF task force to OLAF , even though it was clear that some of the officials were totally unqualified for the job .
result : the new director may come from the outside , but he immediately finds himself ensnared in a system that is already firmly established .
I hope we will not see a repeat performance here !
I can understand the Commission wanting to show that it can produce quick results ; but when you talk to Commission officials , you get the sense of a mood of growing depression over the past months , and not only among the so-called losers , for of course some people are bound to lose out in any reform .
like several Member States , I think there is still some doubt as to what this general reform will cost at the final count or what benefits it will produce .
we are still starting out from the simple idea that in the end the purpose of reform is to achieve greater efficiency .
today we still do not know whether it will and until we do I would advise this House to take a rather sceptical view of the European Commission &apos; s reform process .
after all , we owe it to our voters !
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur .
I have a feeling that these kinds of topic , and this report , are right up his street , and I would almost go so far as to say that it is not a coincidence that this sitting is so well attended this evening .
the proposal under discussion is a direct result of the report by the Committee of Independent Experts .
an internal control service is to be set up .
yet , my group feels it is too early at this stage to make a final decision on centralised ex ante control or decentralised ex ante control within the Directorates-General themselves .
we need to give this some more thought and weigh up the pros and cons very carefully .
I also believe that , as far as this is concerned , we need the advice from the European Court of Auditors .
we cannot make a decision until we have the proposal on the new financial regulations , and within the framework of the discussion on these new regulations , a number of aspects will need to be laid down definitively .
we will be backing all amendments which help clarify the division between financial control and internal audits , as currently proposed .
we are also in favour of providing information more effectively .
in our view , there is one note of discord in the report , although this is not the view of the entire group , and that is the question : should internal control only be set up in respect of the Commission , the Council and Parliament , or should it also extend to smaller institutions ?
in my opinion , it should also apply to smaller institutions .
this may not be practical - it is indeed the case that only a few people deal with financial control in those institutions , but the principle that the person who gives ex ante approval also self-assesses after the event is wrong .
these two activities should always remain separate .
this also applies to smaller institutions even though they have fewer staff .
if we lay something down for large institutions , the neutrality principle proposed by the Committee of Independent Experts should then apply across the board .
I am not in favour of making any exceptions to this rule .
otherwise , my group is able to support all the rapporteur &apos; s amendments , especially those which stipulate that annual progress reports should be compiled .
public opinion is so sensitive in this area that I feel this Parliament should deal with this topic every year , and not only at the discharge stage .
it should also deal with the question of how matters can be improved in terms of control , and , in the light of public opinion , we cannot do enough about this .
Mr President , our group also supports the rapporteur and thanks him for his good work .
I think the Committee on Budgetary Control held important discussions on this subject and the Commission would certainly be well-advised always to draw on that committee &apos; s authority during the further reform process .
I believe that constructive cooperation really can make a contribution to improving the reform .
we believe it is urgently necessary to modernise the management .
we support the Commission &apos; s steps in that direction .
but we also have some criticism regarding the question of final control .
we too believe there is a need to look again at the situation with regard to the independent final control .
all this has to be brought together again in the form of overall responsibility on the part of the Commission .
we also support those groups that are already thinking about extending the reforms to the small institutions .
I believe the administration has to be modernised at European level in all the institutions .
Parliament certainly still has something to learn too and there is room for improvement in its own procedures . we hope that in general with this process we will manage to restore European public confidence in the European institutions .
in future , the administration must be able to react more quickly .
we expect great gains from that .
in the past we often found that excessively lengthy decision-making processes disappointed the applicants and led to a loss of confidence in the European institutions .
modernisation can do much to allay that .
but the annual audit report process is also important ; it must not be confined to the discharge but must be continuous , in the form of annual reports through which we pinpoint where progress can be made , so as to restore confidence at that level too .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr van Hulten &apos; s report was very broadly endorsed in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
no doubt the same will happen during the vote here in plenary .
so , my compliments to Mr van Hulten , but may I also ask the Commission to interpret this endorsement correctly .
by it we are showing that we continue to support the reforms it has embarked on . we want these reforms .
they must lead to greater transparency and efficiency in the handling of the taxpayers &apos; money and help improve the control systems .
we need these reforms so that we can manage substantially to speed up the payments to the legitimate recipients of aid and at long last reduce the number of budgeting errors the Court of Auditors criticises every year .
setting up an independent - and I emphasise the word independent - audit service is a step in the right direction and responds to Parliament &apos; s requests in its January resolution on the reform of the Commission .
however , we want this audit to complement rather than replace the traditional financial control .
that is another thing this House decided in January and confirmed again in the 1998 discharge .
unlike the internal audit , the traditional form of financial control checks budgetary processes even before agreements are signed and payments made .
these ex ante controls are essential because , unlike their national colleagues , the Commission officials have wide discretionary powers in many areas of financial decision-making .
independent counter-checks are essential in order to avoid errors .
if in future these audits are conducted decentrally and in a targeted manner for risk areas , we will also manage to prevent the controls from being too unwieldy .
it is essential for the financial controllers to remain independent , which means they must not come under the same directors-general they are checking .
in short , the controllers must not be under the orders of those whom they are checking !
Parliament has repeatedly made that clear too .
unfortunately , we are still waiting in vain for a signal from the Commission in this respect .
I would ask the Commission to take the necessary steps together with Parliament !
that is in the Commission &apos; s interest too .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mr van Hulten on this very thorough report , which has deservedly received the unanimous support of the other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
I wish to say , Commissioner , that this report is only an interim measure , which means that it is the first step towards building a bridge between our present system of control and the system that we would like to achieve through the reform .
the draft version of the reform of the Financial Regulation is still not available in all languages .
furthermore , the White Paper states , quite unnecessarily , that at the end of the interim period , the Council will be able to take into account whether or not the Financial Regulation has been approved .
the need for legal certainty requires us to bring forward the deadlines for this interim period , which has given rise to many reservations in this Parliament , since it seems that we want to have our cake and eat it ; in other words , we want to move ahead , but without giving up the precautions that are currently in place .
there are overlaps , which means that responsibility is being diluted . expenditure is doubling but there is no assessment of posts , and so many people are doing the same thing .
the staff involved are neither being given responsibility nor being motivated .
this interim period , as stated in the White Paper presented by the Committee on Budgetary Control , is being extended indefinitely .
I urge you , Commissioner , to ensure that the interim period ends as soon as possible .
we know what we want and it is the will of this Parliament , but it is crucial that the transitional period should not be extended beyond what is strictly necessary .
I therefore feel that , when it comes to drawing up and suggesting the agendas for the Presidencies , you should not ask us to head straight for the objective we wish to achieve , regardless of the time needed to make the changes in the audit .
there has also been a certain carelessness , of which I am sure the Commissioner will take note , so that we will , as soon as possible , achieve the aim of this reform which we began with the van Hulten report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission &apos; s great reform project as summarised in the White Paper is primarily aimed at boosting efficiency , i.e. , at making a real improvement in financial management , covering in fact every aspect of the budget .
in future the money is to be spent in a more targeted and effective manner , and of course we also want a better guarantee that the funds are actually spent for the purposes decided by the budgetary authority .
that is the primary aim and my colleague , Mr Kinnock , has repeatedly set out all the steps we will take in seeking to achieve it , for the reform process consists of a great many measures .
let me point out that we have already implemented a large number of these individual steps , be it in relation to workplace definition or to setting up a central financial service in the Budgets Directorate-General , to name only two important ones .
we are now concerned with amending the Financial Regulation , a process which in fact only began in 1998 when people realised how important it is to conduct not only an ex ante control , but also an internal ex post control , i.e. to have an internal audit service .
it is only since 1998 , with the seventh amendment of the old Financial Regulation , that the independent financial controller has been responsible for both activities .
shortly thereafter , the Committee of Independent Experts informed us that this system is not the ideal solution either , because it contains latent conflicts .
regardless of whether such conflicts have in fact arisen , there is a potential for conflict .
that in itself can lead to the question whether the person who gave the go-ahead for expenditure ex ante really is in a position to conduct an accurate ex post control - with the necessary objectivity .
if even the slightest impression could arise that the controller might no longer be independent , that is reason enough for us to split this function again .
that is the proposal before us .
it has also been pointed out that this proposal should , of course , be incorporated in the general revision of the Financial Regulation , but since that revision will take quite a long time - if only because it is such a complex business - the Commission has asked for this single issue to be decided in a fast-track procedure .
on the question of the Financial Regulation in general , let me say very briefly that I really am very sorry that the revised version is still not available in all the languages .
I personally will do my utmost to speed things up , so that Parliament finally has this document in all the languages .
I want to thank both committees - the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets - for this intensive debate and in particular the rapporteurs , Mr van Hulten and Mr Dell &apos; Alba , who was unable to be here today .
I really do appreciate the fact that Mr van Hulten made such personal efforts to find a good solution for this change to the Financial Regulation and thus to get this key component of the reform up and running .
turning now to the proposed amendments , let me say briefly that the Commission approves the insertion of the extra recital .
this recital - as also the amendments to Article 2 ( a ) that you proposed - relates to your concern , expressed here , that the financial controller &apos; s function of ex ante control could be weakened during the transitional period .
that will not be the case , because we have decided - speaking only in terms of posts now - that 80 posts will be available for this ex ante control during the transitional period .
let me point out again - since misunderstandings sometimes arise here - that ex ante control is in fact based on a sampling method .
in the past , 10 % of operations were controlled , which , however , accounted for 89 % of the total budget .
that is why this always has to be taken into account too .
the percentage has now been cut to about 80 % , but it is based on a risk assessment .
that means that we have 100 % control for some high-risk areas .
I can understand the concern that in the absence of this ex ante control - before the money is spent - a deficit could appear .
of course the Commission has taken note of Parliament &apos; s concern here .
so I can only underline again that we have developed a very accurate procedure for checking whether the individual Directorates-General that are to be responsible for this ex ante control in future are in a position to conduct it .
only if they are able to do so will we revert to sampling , to selecting , which is often controlled .
obviously that is a guarantee that must exist .
let me say briefly that the Commission accepts Amendment No 2 , which - most importantly - provides for an annual report by the financial controller , to ensure greater transparency .
in my view , the concern set out in Amendment No 3 is also most important , namely that a differentiated approach should be taken to the different institutions .
that means the Commission , the Council and Parliament must under all circumstances separate ex ante control from the independent audit service , while the small institutions , which do indeed have a far , far smaller operational budget , should be free to choose whether to separate them .
that is , of course , also a question of experience .
perhaps it will be concluded at some point that this should be made compulsory ; but for the time being it should be left to their discretion .
I think that will also make it easier to implement this reform .
I really find this proposal so useful that I am only sorry I did not think of it myself .
but that also shows how important it is for the Commission and Parliament to interact constructively .
let me therefore thank you for your proposals and your opinions .
thank you very much , Commissioner Schreyer .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
parental control of television broadcasting
Mr President , Commissioner Reding , ladies and gentlemen , this report on the possibility of establishing parental control of television broadcasting in order to protect minors tackles an issue which is extremely important and topical , all the more so when we consider the growing number of television programmes on offer and the increasingly wide and increasingly uncontrolled distribution of the Internet .
to this I would add two further observations : on the one hand , the number of minors with direct access to televisions and computers is constantly increasing and , on the other , there is a worrying increase in the broadcasting of violent images - portraying all possible types of violence - both in television programmes and over the Internet .
for example , last week in Italy , a racket trafficking paedophile pornography via the Internet was uncovered . this discovery was then broadcast on the television network .
however , some of the images taken from the sites investigated were also shown , causing great consternation amongst the citizens over the unscrupulous use of such pictures , which are or were certainly inappropriate and harmful for the minors who were watching television at the time .
to return to the report , as you are aware , the European Commission is preparing a report on the implementation of the &apos; Television without frontiers &apos; directive , to be published in the next few months . guidelines and considerations on the protection of minors must be included in this report in an appropriate manner .
I would also like to point out that Article 22 , Paragraph 2 of the directive explicitly specifies that all the Member States must take appropriate measures to ensure that broadcasts by television broadcasters do not include any programmes which might impair the physical , mental or moral development of minors , in particular programmes that contain pornography or gratuitous violence .
therefore , we are all aware that , in practice , this is certainly not a simple undertaking .
however , in the light of these considerations , our task is to define the objectives which we can reasonably expect to achieve in order to be able to establish genuine , reliable protection for minors .
firstly , we must identify all the technological systems in order to be able to manage in an informed manner the increase in the broadcasting via television or Internet of material which could be considered harmful to the psychological development of minors : I refer , in particular , to filtering systems and programme classification systems .
however , we must also take into account the introduction of the digital system , which will facilitate the use and broadcasting of such programmes .
secondly , we must specify that , in addition to the technological control systems which I have mentioned , a further two elements are essential to prepare the ground , so to speak .
firstly , we must promote the development at national level of information and awareness-raising policies targeting families and the world of education in general .
secondly , we must encourage producers to take responsibility for the quality of television programmes and broadcasters to take responsibility for broadcasting procedures for these programmes .
however , having said this , if we are to produce more than empty words to protect children we do need to provide clear recommendations on the protection of minors in the media context .
I would like to end by saying that , in accordance with the vote which took place in committee , I cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 and 4 tabled by the liberal group or Amendments Nos 5 and 6 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists , whereas I welcome Amendments Nos 2 and 3 tabled by the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today we are debating a report that gave rise to much controversy when it was discussed in our committee , all sparked off by the term subsidiarity .
but at a time when we not only have a surplus of audiovisual offerings but also excess consumption of these offerings , we cannot retreat behind the word subsidiarity .
as politicians , we simply have a responsibility , in all the areas in which we act , to protect young people from that surplus .
at a time when we are witnessing so much violence , hatred and intolerance in all our countries , we surely have to ask ourselves where it is coming from .
now , I cannot say : it all comes from television .
but no doubt much of it can be traced back to the excessive consumption of these television offerings , some of which incite to hatred and intolerance , including intolerance towards other nationalities .
so we must give serious thought to how we can check this .
we have a responsibility towards minors !
subsidiarity is to be welcomed . and we want to preserve it ; but I beg you , let us not hide behind it .
it is our job to do something , and indeed we have already tried to introduce this kind of protection of minors with our first &quot; Television without frontiers &quot; directive .
I am thinking now of Mr Hoppenstedt , who fought for the V chip .
but what can we achieve with that kind of technological barrier ?
not much ; children usually know how to handle it better than adults , which means we really must think very seriously about how to remedy this situation .
we do not intend to replace anyone who is doing a good job at national level , but we do want to introduce common criteria and minimum requirements at Community level and propose rules that help people effectively to implement measures to protect minors in their country .
of course I also think that we are not in a position , either as politicians or as technicians , to tackle this problem on our own .
far more important than all this , of course , is the role of the teachers and the parents , and handling this medium correctly .
television and the Internet have to be learned and , of course , also taught .
so what we are doing today is just a small part of the job that society as a whole has to perform .
I believe we must bring up our children to enjoy this medium in the right way and to get parents to encourage their children to watch suitable programmes and disregard the less suitable ones .
that is why we should do both , do our job as politicians and urge society to do its bit .
unfortunately , I cannot endorse the Liberals &apos; demands .
I find them too liberal and not really geared to the interests of the minorities we are considering here .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Pack , how much television violence can a child tolerate ?
the question is not nearly as easy to answer as some people think .
and that is one of the findings that has come out of the highly commendable &quot; Study on parental Control of Television Broadcasting &quot; that is the subject of the Commission communication .
despite an impressive number of international studies , there is still no clear evidence of any direct link between violence and media consumption .
someone may commit a particular act under the influence of an image seen on the media , but that does not mean that the cause of that act is also to be found in the media image .
that is a most important finding , for we must not overshoot the mark in our legitimate concern for the well-being of children and young people and , in particular , we must not mistake the real causes of the sad reality of youth violence .
Youth violence is the result of a build-up of several factors , such as experiencing violence in the family , suffering serious social disadvantages , having poor chances for the future because of lack of education , which leads to frustration , which in turn finds its outlet in violence .
that fits in with the experience I myself have gleaned during ten years of voluntary jury service at a number of juvenile courts .
technical measures to control television offerings cannot resolve these problems .
fortunately , however , the vast majority of children and young people grow up in an environment free of all these types of problem .
that is the best youth protection there can possibly be .
here we see parents who are committed to passing on their own moral values and life experiences to their children .
as a rule these are rooted in a particular cultural , social and societal background .
systems of parental control must therefore also leave room for individual action on a pluralist basis .
that is also what the Commission is seeking to do , with reference to the findings of the study .
basically , the report we are to vote on here also supports that approach .
at the same time , of course , no-one disputes that media images can influence moral values .
but we must make it equally clear that even if we place our confidence in a differentiated supply of filter systems , that in no way takes away from broadcaster responsibility .
the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport has therefore called in so many words for the programme and provider responsibility to be established .
that is and remains mainly the task of Member State legislation , although it certainly does not preclude a consensual agreement on certain basic values in a dialogue with all concerned at European level .
finally , the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport also considered it important to urge the Commission to extend all youth protection measures to multimedia offerings of all kinds , since images of violence and other harmful content are certainly no longer confined to conventional television .
Europe &apos; s children have been surfing the Internet for a long time now , and they are doing so more and more .
it is more important for the children and their parents to learn to use the media properly than to introduce legal restrictions and electronic filters .
that is an educational and social task .
Mr President , Mrs Pack is right .
we are concerned here with the proximity principle .
the EU is facing a number of challenges - enlargement towards the East , the intergovernmental conference and the Treaty in Nice .
these questions are at the top of the agenda .
the problems relating to democracy and to the EU &apos; s closeness to the people are other crucial issues .
it is a question of the EU &apos; s political legitimacy in the eyes of the people - and time is rather pressing .
I believe that solving these problems is a prerequisite for the success of the European project as a whole .
in his splendid major speech yesterday , President of the Commission Romano Prodi mentioned that , for the sake of the EU &apos; s political legitimacy in the future , it will be necessary to produce a list of those subjects the EU is to deal with and those which the Member States are to deal with .
I entirely agree with the President of the Commission about the need to prepare such a list along the lines of a constitution , and I am quite clear about the fact that the subsidiarity principle must be reinforced and that the EU must therefore refrain from making policy on the wide range of areas in which the political problems are not of a cross-border nature .
the EU should stick to the key political issues .
in so far as the President of the Commission has had any ideas about which areas belong where , I hope that he shares my view that issues of parental control of children &apos; s television viewing do not belong on the EU &apos; s agenda .
on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I have therefore tabled a number of amendments , the purpose of which is to limit the effects of this report in so far as it may be adopted .
allow me finally to emphasise that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is also concerned about the increase in the number of TV programmes containing sex and violence .
we are also convinced that these programmes are in no way of benefit to viewers and certainly not to children .
but , all other things being equal , I think it is the job of parents to prevent their children from seeing that sort of thing at home .
Mr President , our sitting is not being broadcast on television !
it would be good for the world to be able to see your imposing figure presiding over the House , and a live television programme broadcast at this time of day showing our alluring Commissioner would be just the thing .
but there are no television cameras here . we are not being filmed .
it is not enough to leave parents to keep watch over their children : we ban the toys !
that is what we do .
and why , in this case , then , do we not just ban all programmes which are harmful to us all ?
oh , no . in this case , we leave parents to keep an eye on their children .
but consider how often are parents at home , how often they have to go out .
we should also ban mobile phones , the WAP phones we hear so much about , which all the youngsters will soon be carrying about town , putting their lives at risk from traffic because they are watching television programmes and absorbed in material from all the different States of the European Union displayed on their mobile phones .
I do not , therefore , agree with the words of the Liberal Member who has just spoken .
I am afraid that the heavens and the satellites will soon be raining signals from all over the Union down on all our States .
and it is therefore important for a European directive to be adopted to prevent the transmission of harmful material .
Mr President , Commissioner , our children access and use televised , printed and new media on a daily basis and as a matter of course .
information from all over the world and from every sphere of knowledge is delivered to the home in record time and our children can communicate all around the world on an everyday basis .
at the same time , a huge selection of different entertainment programmes is available to them , usually without any controls .
aside from all the positive aspects , we must not disregard the negative side-effects of this ease of access .
children are being faced day by day with a growing wave of media brutality and violence , which is simply too much for them , especially because no limits are imposed on these offerings .
so all those concerned , starting with the children , via the parents , the teachers , the countries , the European Union and , beyond them , the suppliers and producers must come to grips with this question and learn how to deal with these offerings and their effects .
the public must be made more aware of the effects of this constantly growing wave of violence and support measures must be taken .
these measures must not be restricted to television but must apply to all accessible media .
the candidate countries must of course also be integrated in this process even at this stage .
since the media market is a matter of supply and demand , i.e. , a question of hard business , the providers pay no attention to the consequences of various offerings .
all that counts is the ratings .
so we must introduce protective mechanisms that are impossible , or at least not easy , to circumvent .
furthermore , I believe programmes that help reduce and overcome violence and aggression should also be on offer .
no doubt they could not be marketed so spectacularly and would therefore produce lower ratings , but in return they could make a considerable contribution to damage limitation and to combating the adverse effects .
we are responsible for ensuring that our young people can shape a future society in which violence and aggression are not presented as hip or cool or as examples to be copied but as deeply reprehensible .
we have to match up to that responsibility by adopting the appropriate directives and providing the necessary support .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , one Sunday evening a fortnight ago in the South of France , Johan , aged 17 , and Robert , aged 16 , murdered their childhood friend , Romain , with a firearm and a baseball bat , for no reason or motive , just like on TV .
arrested very soon afterwards , they told the police , &quot; It &apos; s funny , they don &apos; t get caught that easily on the telly . &quot;
they also said that they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone in real life .
this occurred not far away and not very long ago .
it happened on 17 September , close to home , in Europe .
there is no question of simplifying matters or engaging in generalisations , even if we do have a limited time for speaking in the European Parliament , but there are a great many examples .
it may be remembered that , a few years ago , Oliver Stone &apos; s film , &apos; natural born killers &apos; , generated the same controversy by giving rise to copycat crimes by youngsters in the United States and France .
so when I hear some people stating in debates in committee that there is nothing to prove that television violence in all its forms may have a harmful influence upon children , I am , to put it mildly , surprised .
we are often alarmed at the television programmes our children watch .
the on-screen violence of all kinds to which children are subjected , whether it be on television or through the computer , has short- , medium- and long-term consequences .
the purpose of this report is to help us , as parents and grandparents , to protect minors and to provide us with a tool enabling us to make better , informed choices for our children .
just how is that an attack on the principle of subsidiarity ?
the audiovisual media continue to be the exclusive domain of the Member States .
at no point does the report suggest potential harmonisation .
at the very most , the talk is of tentative convergence .
with regard to the protection of minors in the media context , the definition of common criteria is therefore , of necessity , minimal , given the cultural , moral and social variations in our Member States .
establishing minimum criteria is the very least the European Union can do for its children .
I would also support the rapporteur when she explains the need to make sure that all families are guaranteed the right to an affordable filtering system .
that being said , these devices must not , and cannot , exonerate broadcasters and educators from fulfilling their responsibilities .
children will very quickly learn to manipulate these filtering systems better than ourselves .
legislators - and I have almost finished speaking now - cannot regulate everything , but they must occasionally remind everyone what their rights and duties are .
I believe that that is what we are doing today .
Mr President , I should like to thank both the European Parliament and its rapporteur for the important work which has been done on this issue .
I remember that , when the V-chip was discussed in this House , I was among the MEPs who banged their fists on the table and demanded that parents have the opportunity to exercise supervision .
the Commission shares the view expressed in the report that cooperation between Member States and the Commission is essential if minors are to be better protected over the next few years .
this does not mean harmonisation .
no one wants this , no one has talked about it and no one intends to implement it .
the idea is to draw up minimum rules .
I am the last person to attack subsidiarity .
I defend it , because it is essential .
subsidiarity must serve some purpose , however , and not act as a screen .
I am convinced that , when it comes to protecting young people , we are in prime position of responsibility , and I am also convinced that there are ethical considerations more important than the strictly legalistic ones .
with regard to the introduction of a self-regulation code , it should be noted , particularly in terms of the technical aspects , that , in a number of Member States , broadcasters have already introduced coding systems for television sets to enable parents to cut off the power .
the Commission is also consulting the Digital Videobroadcasting Group , or DVB , about the technical aspects of systems for protecting minors , particularly digital filters .
like Parliament , the Commission also thinks that each family ought to have access to these filtering devices at affordable prices .
as you know , however , no effective systems are yet to be found where television is concerned .
however , filters are available to the public for use with the Internet , and this should speed up the development of similar filters for television , especially digital ones .
in short , when more programmes are put on the market , parents will have the technical means of preventing their children from watching certain broadcasts .
let us not , however , forget the ethical and legal aspects .
the problem is certainly not to be solved at the touch of a button or just by pulling a plug .
as has been said in this House , journalists , programme makers and broadcasters are also responsible .
I should like to remind you that the Commission has adopted an action plan designed to promote safer Internet use and also to make users more aware of the problem .
I think too that , even if this public awareness campaign relates to the Internet , it will also have a knock-on effect on television programmes .
it is true , as Parliament acknowledges , that the Member States do not share the same ideas about what minors should or should not be permitted to see .
the report considers there to be good reason for aiming at progressive convergence , even if it is premature at this stage to define the criteria involved in such convergence .
although I do not think it is feasible to adopt uniform criteria , I think it is our responsibility to arrive at some classification of the contents of television programmes , while leaving parents the option of deciding whether the programmes may or may not be watched by minors .
I should also like to say something in response to the contents of a national television channel which showed offensive pictures on the pretext of providing information .
let me tell you that , in journalism , there has always been an ethical code and a system of self-regulation for applying this code , and this has operated quite well , I have to say .
there are always exceptions , when things go wrong , but exceptions are precisely what they are and all the more shocking for being so .
in my opinion , the profession has to be made more responsible so that it takes responsibility itself for the content of broadcasts and for what will and will not be shown .
I myself was a professional journalist for twenty years .
I will tell you something : journalists cannot write and show everything they know about or are aware of , or divulge all the information they have , because it may do a lot of harm to third parties .
in its report , Parliament also invites the Commission to encourage the creation of a think tank with the job of drawing up a memorandum containing the basic legal principles applied in the Member States for the purpose of protecting minors in the media context .
the Commission will respond to this invitation because , as you know , we are due to table the &apos; Television without frontiers &apos; directive again in 2002 , with a view to testing the water .
I think it will be very important , in that context , to launch a broad debate on our society &apos; s responsibility where the media are concerned .
when I say society &apos; s responsibility , I am thinking not only of European governments but also of political responsibility at national level , the responsibility of media practitioners and the responsibility of parents and of society in general .
I am also very aware of the remarks made about education , about training in the interpretation of images and about making younger people more aware of the need to approach the media in a critical frame of mind and not to watch any old thing , at any time and in any way .
I would also say that the industry has already devised an international system of self-regulation called the Internet content rating Association , in which the Commission participates .
consideration could be given to encouraging the creation of a similar initiative covering audiovisual content .
your thoughts on this matter would be welcome , as they would be in the context of &apos; television without frontiers &apos; .
where , finally , the protection of minors is concerned , I should like to point out that there is a Council Recommendation of 24 September on promoting national frameworks designed to ensure comparable and effective levels of protection of minors and of human dignity .
there are plans for the Commission to prepare a report for Parliament and the Council on the measures taken by the Member States to apply this recommendation .
the objective of such a study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach proposed , an approach based on the principles of self-regulation , and my officials have just set the work in motion and have sent a questionnaire out to the Member States .
one thing is certain , I think .
the problem will not be solved through technical , technological or other such measures . it is society as a whole which has to assume responsibility .
we are in the process of assuming our own share of responsibility .
let others assume theirs and , believe me , I shall call for everyone to play their part in applying a solution .
thank you very much , Commissioner Reding .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
education and training : mobility within the Community
Mr President , this report covers a very important issue and one that has been prominent in my post bag for nearly six years .
if we are serious about the European ideal , we have to be able to ensure that it is easily sold to those who are convinced about the concept and those who are not .
I was a teacher for 16 years and now , as an MEP , I have spent a lot of time in schools , colleges , and at conferences arguing for just this sort of action .
it links in with many positive initiatives over the last few years with which we are all familiar - Socrates , Youth for Europe , Leonardo and so on . young people in general are very positive about the European Union .
they do not have the problems often associated with other age groups .
they are used to multicultural and diverse communities .
but confronted , as they so often are , by factors that work against the European ideal , they rely on their own experiences .
we have to ensure that the experiences of young people - students and others in the educational world - are positive .
nothing will be more damaging to their developing views , than if a report such as this fails to make progress or if it fails to deliver greater mobility or if it fails to at least start to demolish the barriers that confront educational mobility today .
back to the beginning .
when it first presented its report , the Commission accepted that its recommendation was less than satisfactory .
I understand that it even considered withdrawing it .
since then , a great deal of work by my own staff , by Parliament &apos;s staff and indeed by the Commission &apos;s own staff , to all of whom I pay warm tribute , has presented us with what I thought , until today , was perhaps a worthy if not perfect report , certainly one that was satisfactory and would go some way to achieving my aims .
today , and at the eleventh hour , the Commission have advised me , albeit indirectly , of its difficulties .
firstly , I understand that the Commission now believes that all references to researchers to be outside the legal base as provided for under Articles 149 and 150 .
I ask the question : why is this information only available on the 4 October ?
why has someone waited until now to come up with this ?
was this legal advice not known when on numerous occasions I discussed its inclusion with members of the Commission staff ?
indeed , when Mr Mantovani and I and the whole Social Affairs Committee were encouraged to progress the case , why was I told that the researchers would be the subject of a later Commission recommendation if there is no legal base for it ?
and why in 1996 did the Commission publish a Green Paper - Education , Training and Research - if there was no legal base for it ?
was that , I ask , not a waste of Commission and Parliament time and indeed money , then and now .
no-one has more respect than I for Mrs Reding and her Commission staff so I am sure that tonight in her response she will be able to address the particular points that I raise and that she will not present a prepared statement .
I will now turn to some of the particulars which I addressed in the report - details which were defined and honed in response to discussions with a huge number of parties , from students to ministers , teaching unions to government , representatives from several , if not all , the countries .
the report seeks to remove legal and administrative , and indeed cultural , barriers to mobility .
it promotes the wider use of a variety of financial means of assistance .
it tries to promote an EU-wide area of qualifications and specifically to make the lot of third-country nationals easier regarding mobility .
specifically my report replaces the worthy international generalisations by , in effect , repatriating the decisions to the Member States .
I tried to make sure that the report only covers areas over which Parliament and the Commission has jurisdiction .
I have endeavoured to ensure the recommendations with any fiscal implication are limited to a bare minimum .
as with any Parliament report , experience has shown that there is little chance of anything happening , or at best little possibility of uniformity across Europe , if there is no monitoring .
for reasons which I understand , but which will have the effect of neutering the whole report , the Commission will , I am led to believe , be rejecting Amendments Nos 46 to 51 .
indeed , they have already press-released it to the effect that they are going to do so .
in conclusion , I was both pleased and flattered when this report was referred to by President Chirac in his speech to Parliament some weeks ago .
if the French Presidency are now serious , then I suggest that Council will have to work very hard to salvage both their and the Commission &apos;s reputation as a matter of urgency for I suggest the failure to endorse this report in its entirety will send all the wrong , and very confusing , messages to important groups of our society .
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
( it ) Mr President , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on this proposal for a recommendation , I would like to express my satisfaction at the end document , which was the result of a joint effort by Mr Evans , Mrs Martens and myself . I would especially like to thank Mr Evans and Mr Martens for their fruitful cooperation .
during the nineties the Commission produced several recommendations on the issue but no practical solutions were found .
the problems to be resolved vary from country to country : for example , regulations differ on matters of social security , study grants , right of residence and taxation , and there is no system for the mutual recognition of qualifications and work placements .
then there is a dearth of information on opportunities for mobility and there is the barrier of the lack of knowledge of languages .
I would draw attention , out of the amendments tabled , to the inclusion in this recommendation of the specific category of researchers , since this category was originally included in the Green Paper .
this is why the category of researchers should be included , Mr Evans .
I therefore call upon the Member States to make every endeavour , alongside the Commission , to resolve the bureaucratic and other problems of mobility , and to set specific goals in the form of a two-yearly action plan and a final report .
this is the very minimum necessary if we are to achieve that area of freedom which is the basic right of every European citizen .
Mr President , in my capacity as draftsperson of the Committee on Petitions , I should like to congratulate Mr Evans on his excellent report on the mobility of students , researchers and persons undergoing training and to thank him for having taken the concerns of our committee into account .
of all the petitions we receive , many relate either to mobility within the European Union , and in particular that of students , researchers and persons undergoing training , or to the recognition of qualifications .
the difficulties encountered by the petitioners are due , on the one hand , to the lack , or the complexity , of legal texts and , on the other hand , to governments &apos; failure to respond to the seriousness of these problems .
the Commission needs to draw up a list of the problems encountered by European citizens , particularly with regard to the issues of freedom of residence and freedom of establishment and , most especially , with regard to their right to work , study and obtain recognition of their qualifications in other Member States .
this list must be accompanied by practical measures such as the establishment of objectives to be achieved by the Member States and the obligation on the latter to prepare periodic reports on the progress achieved .
student mobility would be improved if the periods of study completed in each Member State , together with the qualifications and certificates acquired , were to be fully recognised within the European Union .
the European Commission should take ambitious initiatives designed , in the short term , to provide for the reciprocal recognition of academic qualifications between Member States .
by responding to the problems of daily life , this European Parliament and Council Recommendation should make it possible to bring Europe closer to its citizens , in particular its youngest citizens who should be the forces involved in creating a European identity .
Mr President , the 1996 Green Paper on mobility lists the obstacles to mobility .
four years down the line , we have to recognise that very little has been done .
there are still major obstacles , for example in the field of social security , health cover , extending residence permits , taxation , etc .
I lament the fact that , as a consequence , young people are prevented from gaining experience - study , work or other experience - in another Member State .
it is about time that Europe turned its attention once more to the sound implementation of programmes such as Socrates and Youth for Europe .
it is thanks to these programmes that young people can come into contact with the thinking , the language and the culture of other countries .
this is why these programmes which promote student mobility are so crucially important .
after all , the experiences which these people gather contribute to a broader understanding of European cultures , they enhance professional experience and the command of languages , encourage familiarity with the European patrimony and increase the chances of finding employment .
this is why thresholds need to be lowered on behalf of students , volunteers , university teachers and researchers - yes , I include researchers in this as well .
in line with the 1996 Green Paper on mobility , this group should also benefit from the recommendations in this report .
I believe that the European Commission was wrong to exclude them .
some outstanding payments date back as far as 1996 .
the French Presidency has prioritised improved mobility for this target group .
Mr Evans has done sterling work and thanks to sound cooperation , the Culture Committee approved the report on mobility unanimously last month .
this is a sign that the continuous obstacles to mobility which stand in the way of students , volunteers , university teachers and researchers should be swiftly removed .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , promoting the mobility of students , trainers and teachers is being seen as an ever more important part of the European strategy .
it was given attention , for example , in Lisbon last March at the summit there , in which matters of employment , social participation and the information society were focused on .
in the Lisbon conclusions , mobility was recognised as an essential element in the information society and in the promotion of lifelong training .
Robert J. Evans &apos; s report therefore discusses an extremely important issue .
the greatest credit goes to the rapporteur for an approach based on the point of view of the public and the practical problems involved .
mobility is not to be promoted by noble objectives but by removing the day-to-day obstacles .
I hope that the main amendments adopted by the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport will be received positively by the Council , as they deserve to be , and that legislation is speedily brought into effect .
when it comes to student and teacher mobility , experience shows that the real problems of mobility are not found so much in the area of educational administration , but with the social , tax and immigration authorities .
problems with regard to retaining social security benefits , transferring benefits , and taxation still hamper mobility within the Union .
questions of responsibility have also been raised , especially when it is a matter of on-the-job learning .
regarding our own problems in the education sector , we cannot steer away from the difficulties there are in approving study credits .
students are still pretty much dependent on the good will of the lecturers .
if that is missing , study abroad might unduly extend the actual length of time a person studies .
I am very glad that the rapporteur pays attention in his report to the opportunities for nationals of countries applying for membership to be included in the recommendations on mobility .
the most serious problems at present concern those coming from non-member countries .
improving their status will be an effective way of building a common Europe .
what is also important in this report is the attention given to the equal treatment of those who are the most disadvantaged , for example , the disabled .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani for their work .
our group - the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party - has tabled amendments which include the category of researchers in the recommendation : we are therefore in favour of including researchers .
moreover , we would stress that , although the proposal is certainly a firm step in the right direction , in our opinion , there are certain gaps which will require us , or rather the Commission , to work on eliminating all the remaining barriers of an administrative , legal , linguistic and cultural , but also financial nature .
at the same time , it needs to produce active measures firmly promoting the teaching of at least two Community languages in every country and developing and supporting the cultural and linguistic education of our young - and not-so-young - citizens . this should include the use of new methods and new technologies .
we also agree that there is a need to give all those who participate in this mobility system clear , comprehensive information regarding their social security rights . in addition , we agree that direct and indirect taxes such as the tax payable for renewal of residence permits should be abolished immediately .
certainly , as Liberal Democrats , we agree that this mobility system should be extended to include the candidate countries as soon as possible , and we would like to express our regret at the continuing delay in the mutual recognition of qualifications , an issue with which Commissioner Reding is quite familiar and which we know to be very important to her .
Commissioner , we call upon you to act incisively within the Commission on this unresolved matter , so that , in full respect for national powers and sovereignty , we will indeed be able to talk of a Europe of peoples , a Europe of citizens , but also a Europe of culture .
for if Europe is not a Europe of culture , it will never be Europe !
Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the tremendous work which he has done on this report and also to congratulate the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Petitions who have drafted opinions .
this is a very sensitive subject because , as my colleagues have already pointed out to the Commission and Council , a lot of hindrances are put in the way of students , lecturers , people undergoing training and volunteers with regard to mobility within the Community .
freedom of movement for persons , goods , services and capital is enshrined in our treaties and yet young people , who are the future of the European Union and perhaps have fewer prejudices than some of us adults are denied opportunities because of the bureaucratic barriers put in their way .
the SOCRATES Programme was mentioned as one example of this .
a survey carried out by the Commission in 1998 on the ERASMUS Programme , covering 10,000 students , showed that less than 50 % of the available places were actually taken up on a full-time basis and that over 60 % of the students who took those courses encountered financial difficulties .
what this highlighted was that unless some serious remedial action is taken on the financing of the ERASMUS Programme and the kind of support that is made available to students , there will be inequality between those whose parents can afford to send them and those whose parents cannot .
I spoke on this issue in this House in the last session , but I would once again urge EU education ministers to grasp the nettle and make sure that proper initiatives and proper funding are put in place . I would also call on the Commissioner to ensure that in the next round of proper funding is available for the ERASMUS Programme .
one point I would like to raise finally while we are on the subject of mobility is the ongoing case in one of the Member States of the European Union with which I have been involved for the last five years , namely the question of foreign lecturers in Italy .
despite several opinions from the courts , recommendations from Commissioners and actions at Council level , nothing has been done to regulate the position of these foreign lecturers whose status was reduced by the Italian education minister .
action needs to be taken to ensure that those inequalities do not continue .
I would commend this report to the House and recommend support for the amendments put forward by Mr Evans .
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish , informally but nonetheless from the heart , to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Evans and Mrs Martens , as well as the draftspersons of the opinion , because to my mind , these issues have not been addressed so directly , sincerely and authentically for a very long time .
I believe this to be political honesty , even if it is not pleasant to hear .
we have spoken many times about mobility and the shortcomings that exist in its regard .
I would say that in Europe we are currently living in a climate of considerable moral fraud .
fraud , not necessarily in the eyes of the law , but certainly moral fraud , because we are sending students to other countries and then we give no recognition to their studies and nor do we give them certificates .
this is moral fraud , in which we are willing partners .
what can we do ?
I think that we can do a great deal .
as the Commission and Parliament , we can demand compliance from programmes that are funded by the Commission .
we cannot allow universities not to recognise qualifications .
Europe &apos; s universities , in France , Spain and elsewhere , are autonomous and have the power to decide whether they will recognise diplomas and the subjects that have been studied .
universities that do not comply , however , must forfeit their subsidies .
there must be clear checks and monitoring , even if only of a sample , and above all , a web site , where students can register their complaints .
this is not expensive at all .
we are not only protecting the rights of young people , since the same applies to researchers .
it is pointless to talk about lifelong learning if we ignore researchers .
Mrs Reding , Mr Busquin and his Directorate-General are not doing anything about the training of researchers , nor about the recognition of postgraduate qualifications or about doctors &apos; training .
this has today created a void in the European Union and unless the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport addresses the problem , Europe will probably not be in a position to compete in the media , in the cinema or in research in information technology .
our human resources are our only future in a world in which there is no more valuable commodity than knowledge .
we cannot allow this field to be taken away from us , even if this makes things uncomfortable in terms of the European Parliament working closely with the Commission .
I think we should ask Mr Prodi to do everything possible to ensure that young people studying abroad do not feel like orphans and that researchers are not left without support , at the mercy of what their rectors decide .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is our declared aim to make Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge society in the world , an economic area that is able to achieve sustained economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion .
so we must make every effort to close the existing gap between words on paper and the actual , practical difficulties the European citizen still encounters every day .
here , the European dimension in the field of education and training plays an important role .
we must , therefore , ensure that the freedoms laid down in the Treaty such as the right of residence and free movement , do not remain empty words .
transnational mobility is not just an occupational and economic requirement but calls for a forward-looking basic approach .
precisely for that reason I am still very surprised to see how many obstacles remain to greater mobility and flexibility in Europe .
we therefore call for research workers to be included in the scope of the recommendations .
finally , we call for measures to create greater transparency in the recognition of qualifications , periods of study and training .
we call on the Commission to play a more active role in promoting the mutual recognition of training certificates , which advance mobility and flexibility , so that we really can achieve our declared aims .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , may I first of all thank the rapporteur and also all those , in the relevant committee and in this Chamber , who have committed themselves to making mobility a reality .
believe me , I know what you are saying , and a lot more besides .
it is through practical action and not through green or white papers or , for that matter , black or red ones , that problems are solved .
and what we have here is practical action .
believe me , it is not easy .
do not imagine that , by setting a recommendation down on paper , there will be cheers of joy from all the Member States .
no , a number of Member States will have to be forced to eliminate obstacles of a kind which may seem ridiculous .
however , there are still definitely barriers to the removal of these obstacles , and I have not finished persuading all the Member States of the fact , but I am still optimistic .
I am an optimist for two reasons .
first of all because , as a European Commissioner , if I want to make progress , I cannot allow myself to be pessimistic ; and secondly because , in spite of all the problems of which I am aware , hundreds of thousands of students and hundreds and thousands of parents and grandparents thank me when I meet them and tell me that the experience they were able to have was terrific .
go into the street and ask young , and not so young , people which European programmes they have heard of , and they will tell you - Socrates and Erasmus .
so , in spite of the persistent problems , of which I am aware , these programmes are of positive value and contribute something to the people of Europe .
I agree with you that the obstacles which still exist need to be removed .
I would thank you for your cooperation on this matter .
it is easy to talk in a speech about removing obstacles , but less easy to remove them in practice .
what is more , most of the problems of which we are aware do not stem from the Commission but from the Member States and even the regions .
what , then , is the state of play regarding the financial problems ?
Mrs Pack , you are witness to the fact that the Commission and Parliament had agreed between themselves to request more money because they knew very well that the Erasmus grants were not enough and that only those who received help from their parents or grandparents or who worked during their Erasmus studies had the opportunity of benefiting from these Erasmus grants .
all right , what was given was given .
you have to make do .
that is why I have asked the ministers , since they have not given me any more money , to ensure that supplements to the Erasmus grants are offered in their countries , and this is something we are discussing .
last Saturday , I was in Paris for a Council of Ministers for Education , exclusively on the issue of mobility .
things are moving , and not just in the abstract .
the rapporteur quoted President Chirac &apos; s words on mobility .
the French Presidency wishes to make mobility one of the key issues of its term of office , and will go on to do just that .
in November , the Ministers of Education are going to take a decision not only on this recommendation , which is a small step in the right direction , but also on an action plan to be implemented in order to facilitate mobility and turn this into a reality .
at the Council meeting in Nice , mobility will be one of the items for discussion .
so you see , things are moving .
not everything needs to be seen in negative terms , because there is a lot of progress .
I would say to you , however , that , for things to continue to move , some pressure needs to be exerted .
so , help me to apply some pressure .
you are doing so today and will do so tomorrow .
I should like to thank you right now for doing this .
I should also like to say that the French Presidency is not the only one to have made progress in this area .
the Portuguese Presidency did a marvellous and very useful job of preparing the ground , and I should like to pay tribute to both Presidencies for the way they wish to make progress .
the Lisbon Summit was something of a point of departure for a long journey which we are only just beginning .
our Heads of State and of Government and the regional and national governments have realised that education has a role to play if we want to develop the economic and social sides of the European Union .
the creation of a Europe of knowledge is therefore a very important step in the right direction , but we still have a very long way to go .
I have no hesitation in telling you that we shall do more than just talk . we shall take practical steps , but it cannot happen overnight .
we have to keep chipping persistently away at the issue and never give up applying the pressure . however , we shall get there .
with regard to the amendments , the following may be accepted : 4 , 5 , 11 , 12 , 16 to 18 , 25 to 27 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 33 to 38 , 40 , 41 , 44 , 52 , 53 , 54 and 55 .
I am also able to accept the following amendments , as reworded : 7 , 9 , 13 , 20 , 23 , 29 , 32 , 42 , 52 and 57 on the basis of the English text .
and , finally , I am able to retain the following amendments in part : 6 , 10 , 15 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 24 and 42 .
that is almost all of them .
let us now turn to the amendments which present problems . these concern researchers .
ever since the beginning , it has been more or less clear that researchers could not be part of the recommendation .
however , as is its proper role , Parliament has exerted pressure for researchers to be included in the text nonetheless .
the Commission has responded to Parliament , and these problems were tackled in a communication adopted on 18 January on the European Research Area and , in the follow-up to this communication , Commissioner Busquin will be presenting a communication on the mobility of researchers .
there will therefore be a specific communication on this subject , and I think it is partly thanks to the pressure exerted by Parliament that this is going to happen .
allow me now to return to Amendments Nos 46 to 51 which , with a view to ensuring that the recommendation is followed up , request the Member States and the Commission to put in place a process which might be considered similar to the Luxembourg process in the case of employment .
I agree with the objective , but there is an important reason why the Commission has adopted the position it has on these amendments , and that is because , by accepting them as they stand and in their present proposed wording , the same problem would arise as when we speak about the action plan which the ministers and the Commission want to have finished drafting by November .
considerable new human resources , which do not exist at present , would be necessary .
I did not want to leave the matter as it stands .
that is why I spoke about it this morning at the meeting of the Commission , and the conclusion drawn by the Commissioners was clear .
following the communication of the 26 July on matching human resources to the institution &apos; s tasks , the Commission cannot accept new tasks unless the budgetary authority allocates it the necessary resources for carrying these out .
this is a position of principle , to be applied generally and not only to what is of concern to us now .
it is a collegiate position adopted by the Commission , in view of the decisions taken , in view of the peer group and in view of staffing problems .
from now on , the Commission will give the same answer on all topics .
the budgetary authority will therefore have to ensure that we have the material resources for taking action .
that being said , I should nonetheless like to remind you that the Commission already has a monitoring system which will be placed within the framework of the new open method of coordination , recommended by the Lisbon European Council .
this open method of cooperation is based upon the assumption that European guidelines will be established , the implementation of which it will be possible to adapt in relation to regional and national diversity .
it will also , however , enable monitoring to be carried out periodically so that the Member States can progressively develop their own strategies where mobility is concerned .
I think , Mr Mantovani , that , over and above the questions of principle that bind me to the Commission &apos; s collegiate decision , there is an avenue to be explored here , and it might perhaps be necessary to look for alternatives in this area .
in any case , I am happy to have a discussion with you to see what can be done in this respect .
a good start has been made .
finally , Amendment No 58 cannot be adopted , quite simply because it duplicates Amendment No 37 proposed by Parliament on the same subject .
we all want the same thing .
we want there to be real progress on this issue in the real conditions in our regions and our Member States .
I should also like to do much more when it comes to the recognition of qualifications .
at the moment , and as the Treaties at present stand , it is a national responsibility , which is not to say that I am not doing anything .
I am in constant discussion with ministers . I also know that account has to be taken of the autonomy and independence of universities but , by means of our network systems , we have brought the universities closer together , and they engage ever more frequently in joint ventures and recognise students from other universities and studies completed in those universities .
things are moving slowly , and that is frustrating because the objective can be seen there before us .
it is a fine objective , and we should like matters to move more quickly .
in politics , things do not , unfortunately , always move as quickly as one would wish .
if , however , the pressure is kept up , we shall get there .
so , help me to do just that .
thank you very much , Commissioner Reding .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .

address by Mr Ciampi , President of the Italian Republic
Mr President , it is my great honour to welcome you to the European Parliament .
I hope I will be forgiven for mentioning the excellent memories that I cherish of my official visit to Italy last March , the especially warm welcome I received , that you gave me , Mr President , and the depth and clarity of your approach to Europe .
your visit today comes at what is a crucial time for European integration .
we do of course have good cause for rejoicing in this regard , and we were talking about this a few seconds ago , following the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights last Monday by the groups that make up the Convention .
we are conscious , Mr President , that you have promoted this Charter right from the outset .
you even believed in this project at a time when it was , for some , more a utopian dream than a tangible prospect .
on many occasions , you have reiterated your desire for the Charter to be granted genuine legal effect .
even if the future of this text is now in the hands of the European Councils at Biarritz and then at Nice , this House looks forward to the results of these negotiations with a sense of optimism .
this optimism has been heightened in recent days by the numerous interventions that we have heard from the Member States .
but now is also the beginning of a key stage for the Intergovernmental Conference .
at Leipzig on 6 July , you issued a call for a vision for the future of Europe , based on a draft constitution .
we would like to join with President Chirac and Minister Fischer in saying how much we value this move .
it is one that has initiated a genuine political debate on the future of Europe , and I have no doubt that your speech today will provide us with an opportunity to take this debate still further .
Mr President , you can be sure of this Chamber &apos;s commitment to this great European project .
we , for our part , are sure that we can count on a telling contribution from your country , whose actions have always been decisive each time that a major step is taken towards European integration .
thank you , Mr President , for having shared with us your beliefs and your ambitions .
you have delivered a speech stamped both with idealism and with resolute realism . it is a speech which , I can say in all sincerity , has provided us with a source of encouragement and optimism .
you have outlined , in an admirable fashion , the major challenges facing Europe today - institutional reform , control of the economy , the issues of defence and enlargement - and I have noted that you view these as a political imperative , but also as an ethical imperative .
your intervention is also an act of faith in Europe , and one that you propose anchoring in our civil society .
you have stated that you want the Charter of Fundamental Rights to become the first part of a Constitution , and it cannot have escaped you that this idea tallies with the wishes and will of a large part of this House .
you have reminded us of the responsibility that Europe has , within the international community , for establishing values in the fields of democracy and human rights , and of the dramatic events in the Middle East .
the events in Yugoslavia , which give cause for hope but which are also at a highly critical stage , are also being followed by this House as closely as you would expect .
we are aware , it is true , that much is expected of Europe and of the European Parliament .
we were particularly conscious of this , Mr President , last September , when we welcomed the Speaker of the Knesset and the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council , who came here together , to this very rostrum , to deliver a message brimming with peace and hope .
finally , you have demonstrated your confidence - and I would thank you for this - in the role played by the European Parliament and in the cooperation between our institutions , and more especially between the European Parliament and the Commission .
the way in which this House received the very powerful speech made by Mr Prodi yesterday showed not only that this cooperation is harmonious , but also that we have shared ambitions for the future of Europe .
you can rely on our institutions to bring their full weight to bear to reach solutions which are commensurate to the challenges we face .
( loud applause ) ( The formal sitting was closed at 12.35 p.m. )
equal opportunities
the next item is the joint debate on :
the Council statement on : equal opportunities ; equal participation by men and women ;
the report ( A5-0198 / 2000 ) by Mrs Dybkjær , on behalf of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Equal Opportunities , on the Commission annual reports &apos; Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union - 1997 , 1998 , 1999 &apos; .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is the third time I have had the pleasure of addressing the House since the French Presidency began . I first addressed the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities on 11 July and , on 5 September , I made a statement about the monitoring centre for industrial change .
today , I am here to talk about balanced participation by men and women in all areas of society .
the motion for a resolution on the Commission &apos; s reports that you will be voting on later goes into great detail on the subject .
I would like to comment on three points highlighted by Mrs Dybkjær , and I commend the quality of her work as rapporteur to this House .
first , as regards the need for regular assessment and monitoring of equality at every level regarding work , employment , education , training , family life , health , and the dignity of women , we will only be able to make significant progress if we have the most accurate intelligence on every aspect underlying discrimination .
the second point relates to the new information and communication technologies .
this emerging sector is opening up greater access to the world of work for women .
we must make sure the gaps in this area are reduced .
we must make sure women benefit from the new jobs generated , while avoiding reproducing the inequalities that exist in more traditional sectors : less skilled jobs , part-time work ( sometimes not by choice ) , insecure contracts and difficulties put in the way of access to decision-making posts .
thirdly and finally , I think the proposal to make implementation of the principle of equal treatment a selection criterion for any Community aid or funding is essential to promoting equality .
because equality is a major political issue we are going to use a number of events to give it prominence during the French Presidency .
I am primarily here today , of course , to discuss those events .
we have organised a Ministerial Conference in Paris .
it will be held on 27 October .
I have naturally invited Mr Rocard , my eminent fellow countryman , the Chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , and Mrs Theorin , Chair of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities .
we will also be organising a Conference on Professional equality on 24 November , bringing together experts , social partners and company managers , to look at the obstacles in the career paths of women .
I shall not , however , be talking about the Conference on Professional equality so much as the issues I have put on the agenda for the Ministerial Conference on 27 October .
three issues will be tackled , and they are issues also dealt with in the Presidency &apos; s major documents , either in the Fifth Action Programme or the Social Agenda .
the three subjects on the agenda for the Ministerial Conference are balanced participation by women and men in decision-making , combining work and family life , and including equality in several structures of the European Union Council of Ministers .
the first issue , women &apos; s participation in decision-making in all areas , shows the serious deficit women still suffer from today in comparison with men .
that is a democratic deficit which is less and less tolerated nowadays .
perhaps some of you remember the Paris Conference of April 1999 , when we reached agreement on a statement , but , with fifteen Ministers , had great difficulty deciding on a plan of action with quantified targets .
that is why I decided to seize the opportunity afforded by the Presidency &apos; s major documents , this time , to move that action plan forward .
I can tell you that my country has now marked a crucial milestone as regards women &apos; s participation in decision-making .
very briefly , a reform of the constitution was adopted on 28 June 1999 in France , with the support of the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic , and immediately afterwards we began debating a bill on parity , which was adopted on 3 May 2000 .
this law will be applied to all elections , including local elections from 2001 .
so , at the risk of seeing their electoral lists invalidated or not having their campaign costs refunded , the political parties must present lists with equal numbers of men and women placed alternately to prevent women being relegated to positions where they have little chance of getting elected .
I feel sure that balanced participation of women in political decision-making would produce a genuine renewal of our whole political life .
such power sharing will bring with it other profound changes in economic , social and cultural life .
the Beijing Platform for Action and the final outcome document of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Beijing + 5 , last June , are along the same lines .
the Finnish Presidency &apos; s report on women and decision-making sets out clear indicators for evaluating the progress made .
I also want to salute the Commission &apos; s initiative - I think my information is correct , Mrs Diamantopoulou - in taking a decision to have parity between men and women within its committees and groups of experts .
we must all commit ourselves to following and developing this encouraging initiative .
the French Presidency would like to make progress in this matter and hopes to approach its partners with proposals for quantified targets for giving women access to decision-making in all areas , the political arena , which I have already mentioned , but also economic and social sectors .
initial consultations undertaken by the French Presidency confirm that this is a central concern in all Member States .
I do not mean to imply that we have already reached agreement on the quantified targets , but I can assure you I am putting a good deal of effort into getting that agreement .
the second issue for this Ministerial Conference will cover combining work and family life .
following the example of Finland , a questionnaire has been sent to all the Member States and this will be followed very shortly by a report .
a proposal on indicators to measure progress will be put before the Council .
I was hoping to make this issue an important one in the Presidency &apos; s programme so as to ensure continuity of the work done under the Portuguese Presidency .
I am thinking of the Evora seminar on maternity and paternity and the resolution on balanced participation by men and women in family life and at work .
because we know that as long as women have to carry the burden of a double working day alone they will continue to face a dilemma between their private and family lives and between their working lives and their lives as citizens .
indeed , as I always say in France , ladies and gentlemen , while a law to impose parity in politics is now within the bounds of possibility , it is more difficult to impose parity in daily life , domestic parity , by law .
just as the public arena should not be a male monopoly , the private sphere should no longer be the exclusive domain of women .
that is why new methods of organising time must be considered , so that all those involved - parents , children , citizens , elected representatives , businesses - have their proper place .
this will be one of the strong points of the Ministerial Conference .
let me add that I have also put this item on the agenda of the Conference on Professional equality of 24 November .
the third issue for the Ministerial Conference will cover the incorporation of gender equality into the work of the various European Union Councils of Ministers .
I hope to initiate a process I have used as a working method in France , a method that works well .
for the first time , several Councils of Ministers will be dealing with gender equality by linking it with one of the items on their agenda .
in addition to the Ministerial Conference and the Conference on Professional equality , I should also mention two very important documents specifically devoted to equality , but within the area of competence of the Employment and Social Affairs Council .
I am thinking of the Fifth Action Programme and the amendment of the 1976 Directive .
on the Fifth Action Programme , I would first like to wholeheartedly thank Mrs Theorin and the rapporteur , Mrs Eriksson , for their work which will , I hope , make it possible to adopt the programme before the end of the year .
I know Parliament will be particularly concerned about mainstreaming and the implementation of strategic objectives relating to equality in economic and social life , and - to return to this point once again - balanced participation in decision-making .
for my part , I undertake to ensure that the programme &apos; s funding matches up to our ambitions .
by the same token , it falls to us to review the 1976 Directive , 25 years after its adoption .
this review will not only bring the law into line with the many rulings from the Court of Justice , but will also incorporate other very important points into Community legislation .
I am thinking , for example , of sexual harassment as gender-based discrimination .
the notion of indirect discrimination will be more precisely defined and the derogations from equal treatment supported better .
this is a particularly important advance for women , as Mrs Hautala is sure to emphasise when she presents her report to Parliament on behalf of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities .
going beyond the specific issues falling within the scope of my ministry , I want to mention three initiatives , very briefly .
first of all , the guidelines for employment , this time fleshed out with quantified targets , which propose to increase the employment rate for women to 60 % by 2010 .
the role of the social partners is also strengthened , and I am very pleased about that .
finally , in a word , the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guidelines .
the second initiative I want to mention relates to the social agenda to be submitted to the Nice Summit , next December .
this is one of the Presidency &apos; s great priorities and , as you know , it opens up a broad field of action in employment , and clearly makes the point that combining work and family life makes a contribution to this .
personally , I would like to see this issue taken into account even more specifically in the social agenda .
I think we can all congratulate ourselves on the fact that the agenda contains a chapter devoted to the promotion of gender equality and , in that area too , I hope we will progress towards quantified targets .
the last initiative I want to stress concerns the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
as you know , the draft is the outcome of complex negotiations which were completed on 26 September .
the document will be submitted to the Biarritz European Council in a few days &apos; time .
I shall stress our commitment to having the articles relating to gender equality clearly set out in the Charter .
I am frequently asked about this .
I know I have already used up my speaking time so I shall be very brief , but there are a few things I need to make clear .
three articles in the Charter are devoted to gender equality .
the first is devoted to the general principle of the equality of all persons under the law .
the second relates to the principle of non-discrimination , including that based on gender .
the third affirms the principle of equal pay and equal treatment , together with the possibility of undertaking positive action in favour of the under-represented sex .
combining work and family life , entitlement to paid maternity leave , rights of a more general scope , such as the right to dignity and the right to respect for their physical and mental integrity , also appear in the Charter .
so all these provisions make this document an additional instrument underpinning equality .
civil society &apos; s expectations are high , and this has not escaped the members of the Convention , who are anxious to have a gender-correct Charter .
in conclusion , I repeat that the Community level is the right one for making progress together in all the areas I have mentioned , but it is also the right level for making progress on many other issues of concern to women .
I am thinking in particular of the violence they suffer , one of my priorities for government action , and I know that is a specific issue that impels you to action too .
any progress we make in one Member State is progress for the other Member States .
if national policies are enriched by Community policies , then Community policies must also be inspired by national experiences .
I am convinced that together - Parliament , Council and Commission , but also Member States , social partners and non-governmental organisations - we will make progress and I know - we know - that equality between women and men is on the move .
Mr President , I should like to begin by welcoming Mrs Péry back to Parliament .
those of us who have previously heard her in Parliament know that , with her as President-in-Office of the Council , we have a very committed spokesperson for women &apos; s issues , and that is something we need if our plans are to succeed at all .
in the committee , we combined three reports from the Commission and dealt with them together .
on behalf of the committee , I can promise that , in future , we shall attend to the reports in time so that the Commission does not feel it is engaged on a major task , but that we in the committee are ignoring the fact and not getting our reports ready in time .
we have promised ourselves that this will not happen in future .
this is something which , as women , we should be pleased about .
there is really a paradox in the fact that we in the EU have , on the one hand , an outstanding basis for equality - especially now with the Treaty of Amsterdam - but that , on the other hand , there are fifteen men in the European Council who make all the decisions , something I shall refrain from commenting further upon .
it therefore becomes obvious in one way or another that there is a difference between principles and concrete implementation .
I am also saying this because I think it is incredibly important that the EU should be given a stronger women &apos; s perspective , and I say this for two reasons .
first of all , we have had a referendum in Denmark which clearly showed that women , more than men , are opposed to this project , and not merely the project involving the euro but the EU project as a whole .
in Denmark , we have equality in a great many areas , so women ought not to feel threatened by the project .
we see , however , that , on many points , women are opposed to the project to a much greater degree than men .
we therefore have some problem or other , and I will venture to say that it is not because we have declined to say that the EU is OK .
instead , it has to do with this overridingly male-dominated agenda , which women have emotional reasons for voting against .
secondly , we are now facing enlargement , and we know that the progressive changeover from state-run to private enterprises affects women more than men .
because a great many of the countries have said that they want to hold referenda , we have the major task of conveying to women in the candidate countries that the EU is good for them .
for , if we do not make a special effort in this area , I am completely convinced that there will again be a range of emotional reactions which will not necessarily have to do with the EU clauses but with the fact that the EU is , all in all , a very male-dominated enterprise .
in that way , there is a risk of our seeing &apos; no &apos; votes in referenda in the candidate countries , too , and of enlargement failing to go ahead .
I would therefore prevail upon the President-in-Office of the Council , both the current and the forthcoming ones , as well as upon the Commissioner , to be alert to this aspect , for I believe that it is absolutely fundamental to our work that we make a very big effort in this area .
in connection with the reports , I would also say - and the President-in-Office of the Council touched upon this , too - that one of the major problems in the EU is of course the big cultural differences .
it is therefore no wonder that the President-in-Office of the Council is having difficulty getting her action plan through .
this clearly shows that the countries have very different interests , but one of the things we have to work on is trying to find out where , in particular , we can make a contribution in the individual countries .
I have a dream of our being able to obtain proper statistics for the different areas so that we can obtain indicators for the labour market , education and many other matters in relation to equality . in that way , we shall be able to work on things in very much more concrete terms .
I would very much recommend that this be done for the candidate countries too , for it proves to be incredibly difficult to obtain figures from the candidate countries about how responsibilities are divided between men and women in the different areas .
I believe that , if we are to be able to deal with enlargement properly , we must also have those figures .
there were thousands of other things I could have done with saying . I can see , however , that my allocated speaking time has run out , so I shall stop at this point .
I would , however , put a strong case to the Presidency and the Commissioner for our continuing to follow the guidelines which we have indicated in the report and to which I have referred in my speech .
Mr President , Mrs Péry , Commissioner , the reports that the Commission has drawn up on equal opportunities in 1997 , 1998 and 1999 are very important documents and the reference to the Treaty of Amsterdam is a significant step forward .
Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , covering equal opportunities for men and women and Article 141 covering positive measures for employment are a guarantee for women that should take effect in all the policies of the European Union .
we are aware that women do not participate sufficiently in the decision-making process in politics , business or unions .
they have a much smaller share in the labour market than men , a difference that is particularly accentuated in some countries , especially in southern Europe .
they do not receive the same pay for equal work , with the difference reaching almost 30 % in the private sector .
we know that measures for combining family and working life particularly favour women , although research is still needed into the current situation of the family and the role that women play in it , which is no longer the traditional role , because society has changed a great deal , and at the same time , so has family structure .
it is essential that research should be carried out on the real situation of women in the various Member States in order to guide the policies that need to be made if we are to achieve greater equality between men and women .
in order to integrate gender policies into all programmes , we must be aware of the situation from which we are starting and the objectives that we wish to achieve with particular policies . because what really count are the achievements and the advances in the situation of women .
we are aware that the majority of unemployment in the European Union is among women .
in order to achieve full employment , therefore , we need to have positive policies directed at women , which will consist both of creating jobs and of preparing women for the new jobs - information society , new technologies - in which they can play an entirely equal role to men .
the percentage of women in work in the European Union is much lower than that in the United States and Japan , a level that only some northern European countries come close to .
if we take into account the candidate countries , the problem becomes more serious as the levels of women workers in those countries are even lower . therefore , the objective of equality between men and women should be included in all programmes .
women have decided that they wish to work , that they wish to make their work compatible with their family life .
women wish to take part in decision-making processes , in politics , unions , and business , and we know that the contribution of women is positive for everyone and for the progress of society as a whole .
European Union policies should help them to take part in order to achieve greater equality between men and women .
Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , contrary to what the annual reports which we are discussing here might seem to suggest , European women &apos; s equality policy did not originate three years ago , but dates back much further to at least twenty-five years ago .
its launch was accompanied by a great deal of legal creativity , audacity and lashings of political power of persuasion .
if one examines women &apos; s equality policy now , it seems to me , as we are all gathered here - and , of course , most of the people attending and taking part in the discussion are women - that while we are all naturally trying our utmost , we are also aware that European women &apos; s equality policy is threatening to lose its momentum .
it has become an issue for which you have strong feelings neither for nor against .
to put it mildly , it is in a conceptual and political vacuum .
the reports we are dealing with here seem to reflect this mood .
there is a great deal of activity , reasonable sums are being spent , fantastic conferences are being held , everyone does all kinds of wonderful things , but we do not know where it is all leading .
is this policy a success ?
is it useful to draw the goals nearer ?
we cannot verify this , for - and the rapporteur also mentioned this in her report - the goals of the policy are not clearly defined and cannot be measured .
what we need to do , therefore , is to formulate our goal more clearly , so that we know whether we are successful or whether the instruments we deploy are successful .
we also need to define the problem more clearly and identify the problem which the policy is trying to solve .
twenty-five years ago , we were able to talk about social discrimination of women as a group and about unequal treatment .
does this definition of the goal or problem still apply ? is it still appropriate ?
what are the groups in society for which this definition is still appropriate ?
is it not the case that the gap caused by this social discrimination has been partly bridged for certain groups and that others groups are doing very well indeed , in other words , that a kind of sham women &apos; s equality has been created ?
in short , I would very much like us to address the question as to what the problem facing women consists of .
what is the problem which the policy is trying to solve ?
can we reframe this using a more modern approach and can we apply a theory and set of policy instruments which will breathe new life into the policy , so that we do not continue on the same path ?
I may be critical , but it might be useful to shake up the house of cards , which women &apos; s equality policy in Europe does appear to be , where we are all frightfully nice to each other and say everything is so wonderful .
Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , I should like to start by thanking our fellow MEP , Mrs Dybkjær for an excellent report and welcoming her back to Parliament after her recent weeks &apos; campaigning .
we know that Lone Dybkjær did what she could .
I am a man in an EU within which men and women do not have equal opportunities .
it is worth repeating that .
sometimes , some people - even colleagues in this Assembly - seem to believe that they do have equal opportunities , but they do not .
just as some people have said , it is enough to look at this Assembly : the majority are men , the majority of those making decisions are men , and when the European Council meets it consists solely of men .
there is one female Head of State in Europe .
it is therefore gratifying that the European Parliament is represented by a woman in these contexts .
more women are needed in decision-making positions , because it is quite simply unacceptable that so much human ability is being lost .
women do have the ability - and without imposing quotas .
this week we have taken a great step closer to a reunited Europe .
emphasising how matters stand regarding equality in the candidate countries is a particularly important task in the membership negotiations that are currently in progress .
what can be done ?
rapid membership of the EU will provide economic strength , better conditions for women and greater freedom of choice .
the chapter on equality must be accorded equal importance in the membership negotiations .
there must be no transitional periods .
we must monitor whether the directive on equality is really being incorporated into legislation .
mainstreaming is very important in the internal policies of the candidate countries , too .
an ombudsman for equality issues should be introduced , and in the candidate countries too .
the EU should pursue a campaign to combat violence against women throughout Eastern and Central Europe .
the EU should also take the initiative and organise a UN convention against the trade in human beings .
I started by talking about my male status .
perhaps this issue of gender needs to be pointed out in this Assembly .
I should like to conclude by saying that equality begins in the home .
if we cannot share tasks and responsibility in the small world of the home , there will never be real equality in the big world outside , either .
Mr President , I greatly appreciate the fact that France , during its presidential term , has decided to issue Parliament with a statement on equality .
this is , of course , no surprise , as we know that Secretary of State Péry is also extremely active in these matters in France .
she is quite right when she says that steps taken forward nationally can inspire us at EU level and , on the other hand , steps taken forward at EU level can give hints to the Member States regarding the direction they should go in .
it must also be said that France &apos; s constitutional amendment to establish a policy of equal decision-making would perhaps be ideal as a source of inspiration not just in the Member States , but perhaps also at European Union level .
I know that in this we are getting into a very sensitive area as we are stepping into what is almost like the Member States &apos; areas of competence .
perhaps the biggest disappointment in this area with regard to the Charter on Fundamental Rights , as far as I am concerned , is that the Charter does not say that we should carry through the idea of equal representation of women and men in decision-making .
however , this should have been incorporated in the Charter quite naturally - in a modern society such as ours - but this work will certainly have to be continued and gone into in greater detail .
Péry spoke of the importance of reconciling work with family life .
I am glad that she also mentioned that the method chosen by Finland was being used in France , in which quite clear indicators are identified to gauge the situation .
this will also perhaps serve as an answer for Mrs Swiebel , who was demanding that we must be able to define clear targets and that results must be able to be measured .
I believe that this method , which Finland has introduced for the first time , works well in many areas and while it is part of the Commission &apos; s strategy on equality there is good reason to expect much from it .
I would also like to mention one problem in the area of work and family life .
it would appear that it is getting harder for young families to take advantage of the rights that have been guaranteed them by law , as competition in the job market has become so fierce .
we must be very careful that young mothers and fathers do not freely surrender their rights because they are afraid of the problems they might encounter in working life .
reference was also made here several times to mainstreaming , and I can only agree with what has been said here that , for example , in the area of economic policy it is of absolutely major importance to start considering the gender perspective .
the fact is , in Denmark , women suspect that the whole European integration project threatens the rights and levels of welfare women have achieved there .
this , I think , presents quite a challenge for both the Commission and the Council .
Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased with the two reports being debated today : Mrs Dybkjær &apos; s report on progress so far , and Mrs Eriksson &apos; s on the future . I found them both enormously interesting .
today , I simply want to talk specifically about what these reports contain - our current objective as Europeans in terms of equal opportunities .
what emerges from these reports is that it is difficult to move from theory to practice .
plenty of theory , plenty of fine words . no one is quicker than us to say these things or to come out with fine words , but practical results are a long time coming .
why does this worry me ?
because I think there is currently great ambiguity and awkwardness about equal opportunities in Europe .
we want specific actions and we want mainstreaming .
the two things are not easily reconciled and we could lose out on both counts .
for example , at noon we will be voting on two reports on discrimination and equal access to employment which both exclude gender on the grounds that gender is covered by policies other than discrimination policy .
I find that position awkward and ambiguous , and I think that means more thought is required on the drafts you are presenting to us , because there is no certainty that all this will produce practical results .
to take a very simple example , which we were just discussing three days ago in the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , are we talking about defending flexibility or about fighting poverty ?
both are possible , but they are also contradictory , because we know very well that flexibility creates more poverty , and next week &apos; s World March of Women will make that point .
so there are contradictions in our equal opportunities policy and I think we must be aware of that so that we can organise the future of our project better , or so it seems to me .
another example , also full of contradiction , is part-time work .
it appears in today &apos; s reports amongst the social rights .
is access to part-time work a social right ?
I have no idea , but I doubt it .
on the other hand , there is also something in the reports which seems to me very important and which Mrs Dybkjær has placed well to the fore , as has Mrs Eriksson : the fact that in future we need to be concerned about so-called &apos; derived rights &apos; , that is , women &apos; s social rights to autonomy .
what happens to a woman who has spent twenty years with a husband who then leaves her ?
what sort of pension will she get ?
good question !
what is her tax position ?
there is no equal opportunity , there is no real equality for women without autonomy and freedom as social rights , so that they can have control of their lives throughout their lives .
I would like this subject , so strongly emphasised in our reports , to be one of our priorities from now on .
I now want to talk about enlargement , which is still , perhaps , one of my concerns . we are delighted that the Finnish Presidency has introduced indicators and I know the French Presidency wants to consolidate this indicator policy into an important institution .
I am very pleased about that , I am delighted .
but looking at the problem of enlargement , and here I will conclude , because the issue of enlargement worries me a great deal , yesterday we naturally voted in favour of the report on enlargement to a whole series of countries .
but where , pray , are the conditions for women &apos; s rights and equal opportunities in that enlargement ?
I am concerned about that and I urge the French Presidency to be concerned about it .
Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , all of us here agree that equal opportunities for men and women must be pursued in all our policies .
but beyond that , the method has to be defined .
we need to be sure that what is decided in Strasbourg is real progress .
in the name of equal opportunities , and thanks to Europe , French women have won the right to work at night .
I am not sure they should thank Europe for that .
the European method , imposing uniformity , is wrong .
first , because while women , like citizens in general , have the same ideas of what is fair and what is unjust , they do not have the same ideas about their role in the various cultures of the European Union .
nature has determined that woman should carry the future of humanity in her womb .
now , the primary duty of any society is to promote life and hence do everything possible to enable women to reconcile their legitimate right to personal and professional development with potential motherhood .
in that area , there is no equality .
only women can have children .
so fairness does not come into the equation when the roles of women and men are as different as that .
rather than making abortion easier , the French government should be developing a policy aimed at eliminating every material and social reason which might drive a woman to such a negation of life .
every abortion is a condemnation of our society , but never a condemnation of an individual woman .
since I became a Member of this Parliament , however , it has been my impression that a part of this House would rather forget this aspect of women &apos; s lives .
more serious still , I also have the feeling that the institutions of the European Union have the greatest difficulty developing a global vision of society in our countries .
as the debates and regulations go by , a compartmentalised vision of our society appears .
instead of addressing everyone , we compartmentalise : minority after minority , ethnic group after ethnic group .
as a French woman and citizen , this vision of the world is particularly alien to me .
I am a citizen who should enjoy the same rights and the same prospects as any citizen of the other sex , no more and no less .
I do smile sometimes in this House , particularly when I hear that the group most hostile to the single currency are women , especially in Denmark .
when we decide on policies targeting people with disabilities , or blind people , it is perfectly normal to add women .
it is really very annoying that these women , from the depths of their kitchens or household accounts , are rejecting the radiant future of the euro .
they must be re-educated .
the image of the European woman we find in the pages of our reports and directives does not correspond to that of these Danish women , the majority of whom are saying no to the euro .
so , new pages describe her as ill informed , isolated , and out of step with everyone else .
Danish women will appreciate that .
I take this opportunity to salute the Danish women Members of Parliament , especially Ulla Sandbaek and Pia Kjaersgaard . they come from different political backgrounds , but together they embody the courage so many men lack .
it is my conviction that a method is being outlined today through policies geared to sectors , not to say minorities , in this Parliament .
any kind of national attachment must be destroyed , European societies must be reduced to a collection of isolated individuals in small ethnic , sexual , social or other minorities , all run from a distance by a European State as distant as it is pernickety .
it is not surprising , therefore , that Mrs Dybkjær &apos; s report refers to the Beijing Platform , which uses women &apos; s rights as a weapon to defend a particular conception of women and their rights , and impose it on the whole world .
the Polish delegation to the New York conference already had occasion to appreciate the arrogance of a part of the European delegation incapable of accepting other positions more measured than its own .
other Members of this Parliament had to take up the pen to put things right , and Poland thanked them for it .
in spite of these remarks , we shall vote for this report because we are naturally in favour of equal opportunities , but what equal opportunities means most of all is respect for everyone .
Mr President , Mrs Péry , Commissioner , the position of , and relationship between , men and women in society has changed dramatically over the past decades .
the number of dual earner households has grown considerably .
given this development , we applaud a policy which contributes towards the equivalent development of men and women in line with their talents and interests .
the present report , however , puts forward an exaggerated interpretation of the principle of equality .
the diversity or differences with regard to men and women are still not being given enough consideration .
there is also the freedom of the individual to consider .
as a result , the freedom of choice for women , which they strive for , can very easily fuel frustration and renewed forms of repression .
I therefore find it telling that the report is seeking to establish a numerical balance between men and women across all sectors of society , for example in the labour market .
the choice of training and profession for men and women will depend on their own personalities , talents and interests .
to respect and value these differences shows that we still have our feet firmly on the ground .
the campaigns launched by the Dutch government to encourage girls to select more exact science subjects and so-called male professions , have failed miserably .
a European repeat of these debacles appears completely pointless to me .
I just have to get something off my chest . I find it shocking that the representative of the Council should mention the fact that equality should be enforced , yes enforced , would you believe , in the home .
I do hope that she shares my view that the government has no right to intervene in the private sphere .
in addition , the report undervalues transductive labour .
bringing up children , especially transferring standards and values , is of vital importance to our society .
whoever denies mothers the freedom of choice to bring up their own children unpaid , will be presented with the bill later on in the form of youth crime and vandalism .
the idea that women lag behind in paid work compared to men should certainly not be considered as inequality , because it is based on a one-sided , woman-unfriendly vision .
after all , it is the cool , rational , enlightened thinking which advances human beings as independent , autonomous creatures and downgrades women to being the second sex .
when one adopts this thinking as starting point , it is easy to see why one could be in favour of women &apos; s equality .
this choice , however , does not offer any guarantees against evil , suffering or injustice .
at best , it sustains other types of suppression .
human beings are independent and responsible creatures placed in relation to God , their Creator , on the one hand and their fellow human beings on the other .
this means , among other things , that men and women interrelate and need each other in order to do themselves justice as men and women .
this is exactly why keeping marriage and family completely out of the picture in this report represents a lost opportunity .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it was certainly a sensible initiative on the part of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities to compile a report on the Commission &apos; s annual reports concerning equal opportunities for men and women in the European Union , covering the period from 1997 to 1999 .
that was over 40 years ago .
after all , we are already discussing the Fifth Action Programme on the equal treatment of men and women .
Mrs Dybkjær &apos; s report contains another long list of demands and wishes directed at the Commission , particularly in respect of inquiries , which I do not , however , necessarily consider to be indispensable .
once again , we have been left in no doubt on that score .
what I do not see in this report , Commissioner , are calls for the Commission to at last get round to following up Parliament &apos; s very specific proposals .
we have a far more pressing need for concrete legislative proposals from the Commission , than we do for studies and fine declarations and speeches .
firstly , improvements are called for in the existing directives , for example those covering equality of opportunity in the sphere of social security , with respect to public and company schemes .
I would remind you , in this connection , of our report on the splitting of pension rights in the event of divorce , as a result of which , payments for surviving relatives and the retirement age are to be included in the 1979 directive .
I would put you in mind of the overdue improvements made to the &apos; caffeine-free &apos; free directive of 1986 concerning equal rights for self-employed people , including spouses that help out - those millions of invisible workers , most of whom are women - and whom are engaged in small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises without any form of social security .
five years ago , we unanimously adopted an excellent report on this subject , one of our demands being a framework statute for spouses that help out in the family business .
there were two sessions of round-table talks organised by the Commission , and we have not heard another word since .
that was three years ago .
what we really need is for the Commission to at last come up with concrete , legislative proposals , instead of frittering away time and money on reports and inquiries , and wasting time that would be better spent on worthwhile legislative work .
the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities would also do well to take this advice to heart .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Nicole Péry for giving us high hopes of the French Presidency , which has made great strides with its law on equality .
electoral lists comprising 50 % men and 50 % women could be worth emulating .
however , we are still awaiting the decision regarding a formal Council of Ministers .
unfortunately , we are only ever referred to other Councils of Ministers for a decision .
we do not want to wait any longer .
other speakers have made the point : we want political action .
it is high time for decisions on equal pay for equal work , i.e. for Articles 141 and 13 to be implemented .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights has to be more than a fine proclamation .
what we need are concrete implementation measures that will enable people to reconcile a career with family life .
the Fifth Action Programme will assist us in this , but we as a European Parliament have already come some way ourselves .
we have created a network of committees on equality with our female counterparts in the national parliaments , and in November , we will be meeting our female counterparts from the Member States , as well as those from the candidate countries .
we did the same thing , incidentally , in New York , at the Beijing + 5 Conference .
I was the rapporteur in Peking and the co-rapporteur in New York .
the Polish women were very grateful to us for making it clear that the representative who was there at the time most definitely did not reflect the views of Polish women .
I met with some very positive responses there .
I would like to remind our President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , of the important speech he made here .
there must be no glass ceilings in the European edifice .
the European Parliament employs 30 % women , which is the highest percentage rate of all the institutions .
the Commission has 25 % women , so at least there is an upward trend .
the European Court of Justice could do better , as only two of its fifteen judges are women .
yes , and the picture looks very gloomy in the Council on the equal opportunities policy front .
all I can say there , is that the Council is what you might call a developing country where equality for women is concerned .
we have every reason to be concerned .
we have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for equality .
that gives us great cause for concern , and we expect that as well as stepping up the pace in matters of equal opportunities policy , there will also be concrete measures .
Mr President , the Commission reports on equal opportunities are very welcome , but unfortunately , as the rapporteur said earlier , in a practical sense they are not very useful as real measures of success or bases on which to build future programmes , because they are too descriptive and there is not enough analysis of successes and failures .
one of the vital requirements for improvements in the position of women is firstly to know exactly what the current situation is .
that means we need accurate facts and figures .
then the evaluation reports can use clear criteria and give us an objective analysis of progress or the lack of progress .
after all , one of the main criticisms that I receive from grassroots women &apos;s organisations is that when applying for financial support from the European Union , they have to make very detailed predictions about their future work and its outcome .
yet in reports like this , we do not have anything like the same detailed information .
we need to ensure that information and activities reach women in their own communities , and one effective way of doing that would be by developing and promoting real life case studies which reflect a positive image .
I try to look at these reports from the point of view of women in Wales , the constituency I represent , and consider how they are affected by this kind of progress and how they can get access to and use this kind of information .
I would support the request of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights in this report for a major study of women in the EU and in the candidate countries as a starting point for future work .
a lot is being done by women &apos;s organisations , by governments , by the European Parliament and the Commission .
we have heard from the Minister of the progress that has been made in France and we can learn a lot from this .
greater involvement by women at all levels of government and in all areas of life is essential for deepening democracy and achieving and maintaining peace .
we should be encouraging better dialogue with women everywhere - after all the European Union is seen as a pioneer in terms of equality legislation .
the reports are welcome and the progress they outline is a step forward , but until we really begin to exchange good practice and base our work on real statistics , we are not in a position to judge whether we are on the right road to achieving real equality between women and men .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mrs Péry , ladies and gentlemen , as the Commission &apos; s reports acknowledge , major issues still remain to be resolved in the field of equal opportunities for men and women .
in practically every sphere of activity , serious inequalities still exist .
despite the differing situations in Member States , there are generally fewer women in the labour market , they are most affected by unemployment , including long-term unemployment , and by casual labour , part-time work and atypical , insecure and badly paid work .
women &apos; s average salaries are still lower than men &apos; s , by around 28 % on average , which is a contributory factor to women making up the bulk of the poor and to preventing them from participating in social and political life .
with regard to participation in the decision-making process , either at political level , in the business world or in the trade union movement , women are still in the minority .
Madam President-in-Office , thank you for coming here today to tell us about the French Presidency &apos; s interesting initiatives .
I should like to dwell in particular on two terms : articulation between family and work and parité au quotidien .
these concepts and what they stand for are gaining ground in French society and I hope that this interest will be exported to the rest of Europe .
I also wanted to congratulate you on your initiative in introducing the female dimension into the Councils because , as we see on a daily basis , women &apos; s issues are special issues , not just a necessary dimension to every policy .
as far as the Commission reports are concerned , Commissioner , we received them with interest and we examined them in the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities . however , I have to say that we were dissatisfied with the descriptive nature of the reports and trust that future reports which come under your responsibility will contain a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results .
my final comment concerns the situation of women in the countries preparing to join the European Union .
because of the course of our own history and our experience from the policies which we have applied , we have an obligation to help them and I therefore feel that the Commission and the Council should call on the Member States to adopt the mechanisms which allow equality to be applied to all their policies .
we have both a political and a moral responsibility for these countries trying to find their way into Europe and for the cohesion of the enlarged Europe which we are preparing .
Mr President , welcome back to Parliament , Mrs Péry .
thank you for your considerable commitment and for the work you have made a point of doing in the interests of equality .
we are especially looking forward to your succeeding in implementing a policy of alternate listing of women and men in decision-making .
that is really excellent .
I would just like to raise a couple of issues which I believe should , as a matter of urgency , be a part too of the Council &apos; s thinking and of the work it is doing .
it concerns not only women in the European Union , but also women in the candidate countries .
in the candidate countries , the social exclusion of women has been substantially greater than that of men . it is therefore women who have been hardest hit .
many of them have lost their jobs and , with this , comes violence against women , sex discrimination and the trade in women .
many women are lured to Western Europe with promises of a better life , but the reality is the opposite .
they often fall victim to acts of violence and some are forced into prostitution .
consequently we must demand and support preventive programmes and specific measures , such as strict legislation , witness protection schemes and information campaigns .
however , the fact that the existing laws are not enforced and new ones are not created means that the governments of Europe are indirectly allowing the Mafia to continue with its activities .
this is therefore an incredibly important issue for us to get to grips with .
in this area therefore , the Council , especially its men , has a tremendously important job to do in leading Europe in the fight against the Mafia that trades in women , for this slave trade is not something that responsible politicians can push aside , shrug off or ignore .
we have a political responsibility to abolish this slavery of modern times .
in conclusion , I would like to say something about the men - and it is the men that I address .
when I talk about &apos; the men &apos; , I mean the men with power .
it is Prodi , Chirac , Jospin , Schröder , Blair , Persson and the others who must become involved in this , namely all 15 of our heads of government .
Mr President , the recitals of this report highlight aspects of gender inequality .
women are forced into temporary work , they are far more exposed to insecure jobs and unemployment , and on average they are paid 30 % less than men .
unfortunately , the proposals that follow do not measure up to the challenge of those recitals .
firstly , because the majority of them are about creating monitoring centres , collecting statistics and carrying out studies .
gender inequality is not exactly a new phenomenon we are just discovering , needing to be studied .
as regards work , we cannot seek equality and continue to develop insecurity , flexibility and part-time work .
that is part-time work that women are forced into , because 70 % of them would like to work full-time .
today we are witnessing the pauperisation of wage-earning women all over Europe , including France , where 15 % of them live on less than FRF 3 650 a month .
worse , so-called equality is sometimes turned against women : for instance , in France today the incorporation of a directive is going to make night work legal for women .
a strange notion of equality .
other choices could have been made ; night work for men could have been banned instead , when it is not required to meet society &apos; s needs .
in conclusion , fine words and nothing concrete .
that will not be enough .
that is what we will be saying in Brussels on 14 October with the World March of Women fighting against violence and for real work for all .
those are the essential conditions for real equality .
Mr President , I would like to thank both Mrs Péry and Commissioner Diamantopoulou for being here today .
from the reports and speeches that we are considering today we can deduce , as many of us already knew , that the problem of equal opportunities is a structural problem and that in order to deal with it we need global strategies , because as women we are not a category or a homogenous social group or indeed any sort of group .
in the European Union we are currently running the risk of our debate being elitist and of the progress only reaching some of the more informed and more privileged women , leaving behind the rest , who are young women , immigrant women , single mothers , victims of the white slave trade , etc . they suffer from multiple discrimination .
we cannot continue with an elitist debate , we cannot continue to have progress only benefiting those women who enjoy greater opportunities .
our efforts need to be directed at the women who have the most problems , who are certainly the majority in the European Union .
we therefore need to assess the real situation of women , we need to draw up indicators and we need to make our political action binding , so that progress really reaches everyone and not just a few .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish first of all to congratulate the French Presidency on initiating this debate . I should also particularly like to congratulate our former Vice-President , who is fully aware of the problems we face in this House and of the great interest that the European Parliament takes in the debate on issues of equality between men and women .
as the Minister quite rightly said , we are discussing a political issue of the greatest importance and it is crucial that Europe understands that we are arguing that equality is just such an issue .
I should also like to congratulate Mrs Péry , as a French politician , on the coherence shown in her own country , which amended its constitution to include equality between men and women . it also then succeeded in introducing and approving a law to implement this .
not all countries have managed to follow France &apos; s example , which I hope will bear fruit elsewhere .
I should like to say , Mrs Péry that I consider the fact that you are organising a Council of Ministers for Women &apos; s Affairs and that every government in the European Union has one member responsible for equal opportunity issues to be of the utmost importance .
this is the only way in which &apos; mainstreaming &apos; can be introduced across the board in government and in which the equal opportunity policy will gain the high profile necessary to give it substance .
I shall end , Mrs Péry , by asking you a question .
as the Ministry of Equal Opportunities in Portugal is now defunct , who will represent my country at the meeting on 27 October in Paris ?
Mr President , I too would like to thank Minister Péry and Commissioner Diamantopoulou for today &apos;s debate . I would also like to thank the rapporteur , whose report not only contains observations on the situation of equal opportunities in the European Union , but also recommends a course of action .
I would particularly like to thank the Minister for the work she is doing in her own country and as President-in-Office of the Council , and I would like to make a connection between the work of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the work of the Commission , focusing on one point : employment .
the report before us is , I feel , a major synergistic work . the guidelines for 2001 on equal opportunities in the world of employment are starting to become better defined , more specific and more effective .
this is the way forward .
the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights would like to congratulate the Commission and also propose a few even more specific pointers .
I truly believe that this report and the Fifth Action Programme which lays down a strategy are the way forward .
we might do better to stop complaining , or rather to complain but , at the same time , to show due appreciation for the positive steps which are being taken to ensure that we make increasingly effective progress .
Mr President , I will not reply individually , except to Mrs Torres Marques , because her question is really direct and personal .
I was indeed sorry to see that Maria De Belém Roseira was no longer the representative .
she was very active during the Portuguese Presidency , but it is not up to me to make that decision , it is up to the Minister for Employment , whom we have invited to the conference on gender equality .
I will now respond generally on the issues , rather than give individual answers to any one of you .
several of you have said gender equality policy did not start a year , two years , or three years ago .
obviously not , and as someone involved with associations for social change - because I too , like many of you , have some thirty years of involvement with these associations behind me - I know how hard the social movement , the feminist movement and the intellectual movement , naturally , have worked to move this issue forward , and today we take our places in roles of responsibility in our institutions .
the history of the women &apos; s movement goes back way over fifty years : I sometimes remember Olympe de Gouges , who dared to call for a declaration of women &apos; s rights and gender equality , and was condemned to the scaffold in 1793 .
of course the history of feminism is very long .
my second comment is about inequality in the world of work .
ladies and gentlemen , political will is clearly not enough to eliminate every possible social inequality overnight , especially in the world of work .
management , the unions and the market have a role to play , but we do what we can by expressing a political will .
I can tell you in one sentence what I am doing about it : I have wasted no time proposing a law to improve equality in the world of work .
this is currently being debated in Parliament , and I have introduced a provision , which obviously does not suit everyone in my country , but which is compulsory and will compel each company or profession to negotiate on equality in the workplace every three years , covering salaries , conditions of work , career prospects , and access to lifelong training .
my third comment is about your doubts : plenty of speeches , plenty of documents , plenty of reports , but not enough actual progress towards quantified targets .
it is true that the reality in the European Union is that we have to take decisions as Fifteen and we differ culturally in relation to these issues .
nevertheless , I believe in the need to fight for quantified targets , and to implement policy through indicators .
I did not mention this in my speech , but I am fully intending to propose a feasibility study on the gender institution to the Ministerial Conference , because we need an instrument for monitoring those indicators , and for exchanges of good practice .
fourth point : the issues of the future .
two of you mentioned new social rights , new fiscal rights .
I can tell you that will be the central theme of the Swedish Presidency , and I shall be following it with great interest , because the progress made will certainly inspire French action .
fifth point : the Charter .
it is true that while much has been done compared with the initial stage of this document , we might have hoped for something more dynamic on decision-making .
I have not lost hope , however , of improving the text .
sixth point : enlargement .
in New York I took the liberty of making myself clear on that issue on behalf of my country .
I shall be just as clear today , on behalf of the Presidency .
the candidates really must be helped to come up to the level of the acquis communautaire .
that seems clear .
excluding gender equality from the acquis communautaire is unimaginable , and of course we shall be just as vigilant on that issue as on the others .
finally , violence , prostitution , the grip of the Mafia . if Mrs Diamantopoulou wants to take a European initiative , because we have done things before at Community level to combat violence , I shall be there to support her .
Mr President , what we refer to here and what has been referred to for a century as the women &apos; s problem is approached from two different angles , as the debate here in the House today has demonstrated .
the first reasons that the structure of the social and economic system is to blame for present inequalities and the policy of the European Union and of all the national governments is based on this reasoning .
the second approach says that women , themselves , are to blame for the inequality which exists in society .
this reasoning often leads to absurd distortions , one of which was heard here today , i.e. that the way in which women voted in Denmark was determined by some particular female chromosome and not by the social differences which they experience on a daily basis .
honourable Members , Mrs Péry , the President-in-Office , has given us a superb analysis of the priorities of the French Presidency , which we all believe will be particularly important priorities .
I should like in my brief intervention to confine myself to the report .
the 97 , 98 and 99 reports are not simply working papers .
they are political tools .
I should like to remind the House that the Commission &apos; s legislative proposal due for debate calls for annual reports from the Member States on the subject of positive action because we really do believe that these reports are political tools for three reasons .
firstly , they give us a picture of the situation .
as you will have seen , the reports contain analytical tables , data on each Member State and tables on all the individual sectors .
secondly , because they allow us to make a comparative assessment of the Member States and a comparative assessment of the overall progress of the European Union over time .
thirdly , because they form the basis for strategy , both for the European Union - even in the Charter of Fundamental Rights the fact that we had a picture of the current situation played an important role - and at national level , given that the Member States are able to use the comparative assessment to set national targets .
in my view , the reports which you have at your disposal concentrate on and highlight three issues . the first is the participation of women in decision-making .
the average participation of women is 18.6 % in Europe , 28.9 % in regional parliaments and 30 % in Parliament and there appears to be a very minor increase in the order of 0.6 % from one year to the next .
the second interesting comment concerns the wage differential between men and women which , at European level , is hovering at the unacceptable level of 23 % to 24 % and , in some regions of Europe , is as high as 40 % .
the third interesting statistic concerns domestic violence , the violence which women suffer at European level .
I fully accept the comments in the report and the recommendations by Members who have spoken of the need to change the nature of the report .
I have taken your comments on board and I see that we need to concentrate on analysing data , especially the results of successful strategies and successful initiatives at national and European level , in order to give the report a strategic slant .
however , I need your help here .
my services face huge problems collecting data from national governments .
there are several countries , although one could cite examples for all countries , where it is impossible for us to collect statistics , where it is impossible for us to collect their experiences and results at national level from innovative policies in time .
I believe that , if you work together with your national governments , you can help the Commission to collate this data quickly , so that it in turn can present an analysis of them in the sort of report which you require .
finally , as far as enlargement is concerned , it is of course , as Mrs Péry has said , a question of acquis communautaire .
however , I would stress that , in working with each of the candidate countries , we have been closely monitoring the question of sexual equality , as regards both the legislative framework and the creation of institutions which can support the application of these policies .
as you know , we have starting signing joint reports with each candidate country in order to monitor their adjustment to employment policy on an annual basis .
they contain an entire chapter devoted to the participation of women .
I should like , once again , to thank Mrs Dybkjær for the excellent , in-depth work contained in her report , which will be most useful to us in our next report , and I should like especially to thank the French Presidency and Mrs Péry for being so pro-active on the issue of equality during their presidency .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
Community customs code
Mr President , Commissioner , this morning we will approve the Council common position definitively adopting this reform of the Community Customs Code .
it could be thought , given that Parliament has not tabled amendments to the Council common position , that we have before us a perfect text .
that is not the case , but it is a satisfactory text and , having given it great thought and following an extensive debate , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market decided not to table any amendments .
what are the reasons for this ?
we need a little history .
the reform of the Community Customs Code was enshrined in Article 253 of the current code and a reform was planned for before 1 January 1998 .
we are therefore somewhat behind schedule .
this reform is important because it aims to re-examine the Community Customs Code in accordance with the progress of the internal market and of administrative techniques .
it is therefore an important and urgent reform in a sector that , as we are all well aware , is the real core of European construction .
building a common customs system has been one of the major achievements in that progress towards European construction .
at first reading , in the Paasilinna report , Parliament adopted thirteen amendments of varying importance , which also met a variety of fates when they subsequently went to the Council .
in its joint position that was definitively and unanimously adopted , the Council incorporated eight amendments and rejected five .
I am not going to comment on the eight amendments that were adopted , as we are all in agreement with them .
I am going to discuss the five amendments that were not incorporated .
three of them - Amendments Nos 4 , 5 and 7 , referred to the commitology procedure .
these amendments need to be considered in the new context of the interinstitutional agreement , and therefore , Parliament can agree to not insisting on these commitology amendments given that they have been superseded to a certain extent by the new interinstitutional framework .
with Amendment No 15 , Parliament wished to introduce a recital urging the customs authorities to apply customs rules correctly , to establish monitoring measures in order to ensure that it was applied consistently and to facilitate action against fraud .
the Council considered that it was not drafted suitably in order to be included in the Community Customs Code and pointed out that there is a Green Paper - which is currently being converted into rules - specifically for combating fraud .
we were therefore also able to accept this amendment not being incorporated .
finally , Amendment No 11 requested that this modification to the Community Customs Code enter into force before 1 January 2000 and is , therefore , no longer valid .
aside from these amendments , it should be considered that the common position modified the original text on which Parliament had agreed on two important points : the first is Article 220 , in which the Commission aimed to maintain a longer period for conducting the investigations that could lead to a prosecution for fraud or a wrongful declaration .
the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , following a long debate , considered that it was not reasonable to maintain legal uncertainty for a period of six years , and that three years , which is the period set , is a more reasonable period of time for establishing , with the appropriate means and the average proceedings , whether or not there were irregularities in a declaration .
with regard to the modification of Paragraph 6 of Article 215 , it should be said that we are dealing with a deeper issue , because the intention is that the additional declaration could be made anywhere in the European Union , especially wherever in the European Union the undertaking in question has its headquarters .
Mr President , in the increasingly open economic climate in which the European Union must operate , and given the need to establish trade relations that ensure the competitiveness of undertakings , it is crucial that we establish a legal framework that sets the same rules of play for everyone .
in this sense , the Community Customs Code is an essential support for the European Union &apos; s trade policy , as well , as we are already aware , as being an essential instrument for protecting the Union &apos; s financial interests .
the progress made on the internal market , the gradual growth in trade due to the increasing opening up of the markets and the progress of the information society mean that the Community Customs Code needs to be brought up to date with the development of Community and international trade .
hence the need for and the timeliness of the reform that was proposed at the time with the aim of simplifying and rationalising customs procedures , precisely in response to the demands of the new realities that I have mentioned .
on the other hand , it was also necessary , as I understood it , to establish effective monitoring measures to ensure the uniform application of customs procedures across the whole of the Community and to prevent unfair competition and the opening up of loopholes that could facilitate fraud .
as the rapporteur pointed out , however , neither the Council nor the Commission adopted the specific amendments that I have mentioned , because , among other reasons , they considered that they did not add anything to the proposed text and that fraud should be combated outside the Community Customs Code .
the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as the rapporteur pointed out , accepted that approach , and therefore decided not to re-introduce the amendments .
I must therefore regret that they were not taken into consideration , although I also understand the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - the position of the rapporteur - of not re-introducing the amendments because , ultimately , what really matters is that the Community Customs Code and the proposed reforms move forward and that the legal framework is established .
let us hope that in the future we will at least be able to achieve those guarantees .
Mr President , I believe that both the rapporteur and Mrs Ferrer have highlighted the main points of Parliament &apos; s position and the legislative procedure to date , and they have pointed out how the Council , Parliament and the Commission have worked together in order to arrive at a text that is correct and acceptable to everyone .
I think that , once again , the conciliation procedure , which means agreement between the institutions , is working properly .
however , there is an amendment that the Council rightly rejected .
it is Amendment No 15 , on fraud .
a Customs Code is not the place for establishing rules on fraud .
that is something that depends on the correct functioning of administration and , clearly , in a legislative debate we should not be discussing the subject of fraud .
taking advantage of the fact that the Commissioner responsible for the internal market , Mr Bolkestein , is here , I would like to point out that a few years ago the European Parliament established its first committee of inquiry , which was to investigate fraud in the transport of goods .
there was a report by Mr Bouwman , an excellent report that we adopted , in which considerable fraud was revealed , for example , in the case of tobacco .
there were goods , particularly tobacco , which were entering through a non-Community country in the European Economic Area zone , going through the Community zone and then mysteriously leaving the Community zone on paper , but without actually leaving .
currently , for example , there has been a drop in the price of bananas in the European Union .
it seems that multinational companies are placing their excess bananas , those that they do not sell in the United States and Europe , in Eastern Europe . from Eastern Europe , certain &apos; charitable &apos; organisations , that is mafias , introduce these bananas , which were practically given to them , into the Community market , competing with the prices of legal importers and Community producers .
we could also mention the ongoing fraud in tomatoes , in which we see prices being continually undervalued because goods are being introduced through certain Community ports without authorisation .
if we want third countries to accept commitments , the European Community must be the most zealous in ensuring that its own rules are being complied with , because if a country has the opportunity to place products in the Community by means of smuggling , why is it going to bother to negotiate with us for any sort of concessions ?
I therefore welcome the fact that we have reached an agreement on this subject .
I think that the modifications are very positive , but I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission for greater vigilance and for stricter measures on fraud in Community customs .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although it is true that the text is flawed , as the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the rapporteur have already underlined , I would still venture to suggest that this legislative resolution is an example of transparent , simplified and efficient Community legislation .
after all , in the Community Customs Code , a successful attempt has been made to harmonise and simplify legislation in a transparent manner , which surely must always be the objective .
I can only applaud the Customs Code , and I am , therefore , somewhat more positive than Mrs Ferrer , for example , for it indeed forms the basis of various areas of Community policy within the framework of Community action of the national customs authorities .
in broader terms , the Community Customs Code is one of the most important legal instruments for establishing the amount of outstanding duties and to establish to whom these are due .
the code forms the legal basis for levying these duties and , as such , one of the key instruments for protecting the financial interests of the Community and for ensuring the smooth running of the Community policy in different areas .
in short , I believe I can safely say that the administration now has all the possible levers at its disposal in order to fulfil its task efficiently and within the timeframe provided , and I assume that the European Parliament can invite the administration to make the results of this legislative resolution felt as soon as possible .
Mr President , I would like to ask the Commission to adopt a position on the request made in the legislative resolution for the appropriate measures to be taken in order for there to be a modification of the Community Customs Code , as mentioned by Mr Beysen and as I have also expressed .
Mr President , may I start by extending a warm thanks to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the work it has carried out on the basis of Mrs Palacio &apos; s report This report encompasses all the questions which formed the subject of debate at first reading in March of last year .
I welcome the major overtures which have been made with regard to this dossier , which has been the subject of long and intense discussions within the Council .
I am pleased to note that it was possible to dismiss the reservations expressed by Parliament due to issues of comitology with regard to various proposals .
this opens the door to a major reform of economic customs systems , on which , in fact , Parliament will be informed in detail in the next couple of months prior to approval .
in the same way , the amendment tabled by Parliament regarding paperless declarations , adopted by the Council , will enable Member State customs authorities to have state-of-the-art automated administration equipment at their disposal .
thanks to the initiative taken by Parliament at first reading , the most wished-for outcome within economic circles was the compromise of good faith , as a result of which it will be possible to strike a better balance between the operators &apos; need for legal certainty and the need for efficient protection of the financial interests of the Community .
that has been , as is known , the outcome of a long debate in the Council , during which debate the Commission staunchly defended its view .
it comes as no surprise that this point forms an integral part of the dossier and that the dossier has been approved unanimously .
taking into consideration the delicate position in which the dossier now finds itself , I am of the opinion that the outcome of a conciliation procedure , assuming that the debate were extended , would have been quite uncertain .
it is true that the Commission would have wished to take matters one step further .
but it can at the same time validate the result achieved and keep some points of its proposal in reserve , which can then be brought up for discussion again at the appropriate time .
in this spirit , the Commission is able to endorse the positive balance-sheet of this legislative operation .
it would like to thank Parliament and the committee chaired by Mrs Palacio , in particular , for the efforts made and interest shown by Parliament and the committee with regard to this dossier .
finally , in direct response to the question raised by both Mr Beysen and Mrs Palacio , I can confirm , on behalf of the Commission , that we will be only too pleased to meet and carry out that request .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
( the sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12.05 p.m. )
vote
Mr President , I wanted to speak before you took that vote to explain why I wanted Members to vote against the amendment .
yesterday the whole position changed with the position the Commission has taken on the legal base .
but it is too late now because you have just taken the vote and Members voted in favour of it .
we will just have to press on .
I am sorry about that .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
this is also very sad for thousands of students and others involved in education across Europe .
I am sure the Commission and the House will have noted what you said .
welcome
it gives me great pleasure to welcome the President of the International Olympic Committee , Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch .
the 27th Olympiad in Sydney , which has just ended , was regarded by everyone as a major success , attracting millions of spectators from all over the world .
Mr Samaranch , we know you took up your post as IOC President in 1980 , and since then , have introduced many important reforms .
sport should promote peace and human understanding , and I just want to mention a few important initiatives which have been taken under your presidency .
finally , I would like to mention the launch of the International Olympic truce Centre in July 2000 in Athens which was created through a joint initiative of the International Olympic Committee and the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a view to promoting the Olympic ideals .
this centre is symbolically based in Greece where the first Olympics took place and where the next Olympic Games in 2004 will be held .
Mr President , we are delighted to welcome you to the European Parliament and we hope you enjoy your visit .
vote ( continuation )
Mr President , we are just about to start the vote on the Mann report and I want to draw your attention to the fact that there appears to be a translation problem in Amendment No 63 from the TDI Group .
I note there it was submitted in Italian but in the English language it says that &quot; discrimination which requires men to wear a tie should be outlawed &quot; .
this must be a translation problem because I am certain that the TDI Group would not want to trivialise such an important piece of legislation on equal rights by introducing such a frivolous and unnecessary amendment .
perhaps you could get your services to check this .
we will look into that .
Mr President , this is on a mistake in translation too , though not as important as the one just mentioned .
in Amendment No 24 , the words &apos; difficulté injustifiée &apos; in the French version are a mistranslation .
I trust this will not change the way we vote , but the French translation really must be checked .
the words in the English version are the authentic ones .

explanations of VOTE- Recommendation for second reading Palacio Vallelersundi ( A5-0254 / 2000 )
- ( DE ) experience shows that the economic operators want to have the option of paying import duties in the place where their headquarters in the Union is located .
we Independents therefore support - above all , in the interests of enabling the Internal Market to function successfully - the demand of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , for the Commission to draft a legislative proposal concerning the place in which the customs debt was incurred .
report Evans ( A5-0255 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted in favour of the Evans report .
I would like to start by congratulating the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , Mr Mantovani , on the substantial amendments he tabled to the Commission communication , a communication which , among other things , relates to the movement of young students and young researchers within the European Community .
I said &apos; young &apos; , and therefore the pensioners and elderly people , whose interests I am trying to protect , should not have to concern themselves with this directive .
but time waits for no man : one day the young people will become old people as well ; the young researchers will also grow old and , it is to be hoped , pensioners .
I therefore welcome the amendments which call upon the Commission to treat periods of study and research as if the students and researchers were paying social security contributions , as this will increase the pensions of students and researchers .
Mr President , in my opinion , Robert J. Evans &apos; s report is very important and I voted in favour of it .
the right of freedom of movement of European citizens is still being violated in many ways .
students in particular often encounter barriers and difficulties in Member States that should no longer occur under EU legislation .
studies by the European Commission show that needless red tape is causing problems for students from other EU countries .
residence permits are granted for just short periods of time and it is awkward and costly to renew them .
there are some unfortunate situations .
in Spain students are required to deposit - in a Spanish bank account , note - special sums of money that act as a guarantee in order to rent accommodation .
it is also complicated to arrange for students &apos; families to move .
recently it came out that certain estate agents handling rented accommodation in London would not accept a foreign , for example , a Finnish , guarantor that ensured the Finnish student &apos; s rent would be paid .
European rights of citizenship do not seem to carry much weight in this situation .
this is not the first time I have expressed my views on mobility for students and teachers .
we were already condemning the financial difficulties facing Erasmus students during the last session .
everyone agrees that this mobility must be encouraged in the name of the free movement of persons , but also and especially because of all the benefits to the young citizens of Europe and hence the European Union .
unfortunately , in practice , the obstacles are still there .
that is what the Commission proposal deplores and the Evans report confirms .
according to the recommendation , based on Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty , Member States need to be encouraged to adopt measures which will steadily remove the existing difficulties , and the citizens of the Union should be offered a platform of rights leading to real mobility .
while this proposal is a step in the right direction it still contains a number of gaps which the Evans report remedies .
thus , it includes researchers within the scope of the recommendation .
I think that this is crucial , given that its importance is constantly emphasised in the context of building a European research area .
Mr Evans also demonstrates that people hoping to benefit from programmes in this area need to be better informed about their social security entitlements .
knowledge of foreign languages is accepted as a necessary precursor to mobility .
remember that 2001 has been designated European Year of Languages .
it is therefore vital to promote the learning of at least two Community languages , to encourage linguistic and cultural preparation prior to any mobility measure .
then there are the scandalous taxes on renewal of residence permits .
these must be regarded as an obstacle to be eliminated .
the report also stresses the need to eliminate obstacles to mobility , be they legal , linguistic , cultural , financial or administrative .
I call on the Member States to coordinate the formalities to be fulfilled for enrolling in the establishments of other Member States .
I am especially thinking of deadlines .
to illustrate my point , I need only refer to a case brought to my attention last Friday .
a young man who had passed his Baccalaureat was refused registration in Belgium , because he had missed the deadline by three days !
this is just one example among many .
I shall end by mentioning one of my pet subjects , mutual recognition of qualifications .
to avoid repeating myself , I refer you to my earlier speeches .
mobility inside the European Union is one of the essential conditions for enabling European citizens to feel that they are full members of this Europe we are gradually building .
this is more than a symbol ; it is a reason , a driving force , for belonging to the European culture and model we are proclaiming .
that is why I shall vote for this report .
it lays down conditions to enable people travelling inside the Union to do so free from restrictions on their rights , their social security , or other benefits .
this report is all the more important because it comes at a critical time for the European Union , a time of enlargement .
mobility for all , including nationals of third countries legally resident in Union territory and students and teachers acting independently - outside the Socrates and Leonardo programmes - is one of the fundamental values of the Union which we must uphold so that the candidate countries know exactly what kind of Union they will be joining .
as the rapporteur said , the Commission appears to be aware that , unless concrete measures are adopted , certain fundamental freedoms that are enshrined in the Treaty , such as the right of residence and the right of free movement , are , in practice , in danger of becoming mere statements of principle .
the Commission must therefore adopt ambitious measures to guarantee the right to reside and settle , and , amongst others , the right to work , the right to study and the right to have one &apos; s qualifications recognised in Member States other than one &apos; s own .
- ( SV ) While in principle we adopt a positive view of the European Parliament and the Council &apos; s recommendation on mobility within the Community , we would like to state the following :
we believe that , from the point of view of equality and justice , it is very important that third-country nationals resident within the EU should have the right to utilise the provisions of Community legislation on the same terms as the Union &apos; s own citizens .
we also believe that , to a great extent , the Member States themselves should be allowed to decide on the taxes to be collected .
healthy competition will reduce the tax burden on businesses , encouraging entrepreneurship and therefore the creation of job opportunities .
in this way , the states &apos; loss of income due to tax competition may be offset by the fact that more people are paying income tax .
we are therefore opposed to Amendment 38 concerning the introduction of common tax regulations for volunteers .
I strongly endorse this report from my colleague , Robert Evans , designed to boost mobility amongst students and others involved in training across the EU .
he is right to emphasise the need for further action to overcome bureaucratic problems relating to residence rights and right to emphasise the needs of disadvantaged groups such as the disabled .
I support his desire to see research workers included in the proposal and his comments about the importance of involving countries preparing to join the EU .
I hope when this report comes back for second reading we are able to note that the Council has incorporated the rapporteur &apos;s sensible amendments .
the two-fold approach of education and examinations for master craftsmen diplomas or certificates is prerequisite to future economic success .
mobility and life-long learning must go hand in hand with assuring a high standard of education for our young students and working people .
report Cashman ( A5-0259 / 2000 )
Mr President , I was prompted to vote for the Cashman report by the words of the Chairman of the Pensioners &apos; Association of the municipality where I live - Curno , in the district of Bergamo , Italy - who said to me , &apos; We have absolutely no way of safeguarding the interests of the elderly .
we would like to put forward proposals to prevent them being poorly treated as , sadly , frequently occurs , but we do not have the money to do so . once a year , the mayor of the village invites us all to a lentil supper , similar to the lentil stew Jacob gave Esau in the Bible .
that one meal is all we get the whole year , but there is nothing practical we can do about it . &apos;
so , roll on the financing for the actions to combat age-discrimination provided for in the Cashman report .
that is why I voted for the motion .
we Independents welcome the action programme proposed by the Commission for fighting discrimination .
but we vehemently reject the proposal submitted by the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs to set up another special unit for the implementation of this programme .
discrimination cannot be tackled by creating additional administrative bodies ; but solely by changing people &apos; s attitudes .
communicating traditional values such as tolerance and respect for diversity can do far more to help achieve this goal than the most detailed annual report on the various forms of discrimination .
report Mann ( A5-0264 / 2000 )
Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party , I would like to draw two points requiring clarification to your attention .
I will deal firstly with Amendment No 15 .
this amendment highlights a procedure concerning the acquis communautaire .
the Association Agreements concluded between the European Union and the candidate countries , and those which have yet to be concluded , should incorporate regulations banning discrimination against groups protected under Article 13 .
it is all the more crucial for this step to be taken if certain candidate countries have minorities that require protection on the employment and occupation front .
secondly : amendment No 18 .
the amendment refers to the fact that many Member States have provisions in place that could lead to discrimination against homosexuals seeking employment .
however , the amendment does not emphasise the importance of criminal law provisions in dealing with such behaviour .
it takes the form of a recommendation , in as much as it states that the Member States should annul these provisions .
in phrasing it this way , the principle of subsidiarity is upheld .
this does not fall within Europe &apos; s sphere of competence .
I was slightly disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to get majority support for the need to set a limit on the storage of documents .
I had proposed six to twelve months . as I see it , that would be realistic in operational terms .
I worked for companies for many years .
we were unable to achieve this .
what we did manage to achieve though , and what pleased me enormously , was that we were able to make it abundantly clear that special regulations must be introduced for religious communities , because we must make it possible for people to identify with the idea behind and the fundamental aims of these communities .
we scored a major common victory there , to my mind , and we also finally managed to secure regulations benefiting the physically handicapped .
I am delighted that people have been so willing to compromise today , as indeed our voting has shown .
I would like to thank you all again most warmly for your excellent teamwork .
Mr President , I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 15 months now .
today , 5 October 2000 , did not start well , but it has become the happiest day of my time at Parliament , for today Amendment No 62 to Mr Thomas Mann &apos;s report has been adopted .
I strongly supported this amendment , which reads : &quot; no discrimination as regards access to health care , welfare benefits , and economic assistance shall be permitted on the grounds of the age of a disabled person &quot; .
in my opinion , this is an extremely important result : it shows - if I may be permitted to rejoice at this , Mr President - that there is some point to my being here .
I would like to thank the Members who helped and supported me - for I could not have achieved this result alone - Mr Speroni of the Lega Nord , Mr Thomas Mann , the rapporteur , from the European People &apos;s Party , Mrs Lambert of the Group of the Greens and Mr Helmer from the British Conservative Party .
they have risen above party politics and shown that , when an amendment is right , they will support it , whoever the author .
I have not voted for the Mann report because , while it is indeed necessary to seek equal treatment for people in employment and occupation , it is also necessary to refrain from pushing zeal to the point of abandoning all protection of freedoms and all respect for the rule of law .
this article has been slightly modified by an amendment from the European Parliament , which complicates the wording , but does not alter the general thrust .
if this directive were adopted , it would then be up to the accused employer to prove his innocence , not up to the accuser to provide evidence for his claim .
thus , the usual principles of the rule of law are being gradually altered under the influence of an extremist approach to combating discrimination , with the European Parliament and Commission only too happy to join in and poke their noses into every national law .
yet again , we cannot approve of this shift , which is also going to be boosted by the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , because its present wording extends the anti-discrimination clause that the Treaty of Amsterdam has already introduced into European law .
during the Treaty of Amsterdam negotiations we were delighted with the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on the grounds of sex , racial or ethnic origin , religion or belief , disability , age and sexual orientation .
that kind of provision bears witness to the Community &apos; s commitment to promote a more just , more egalitarian society , and above all , it has opened the way to appropriate Community action aimed at contributing to the fight against discrimination in general .
it means the efforts made by the Community to promote gender equality can be completed by attacking new grounds for discrimination .
it gives new and significant impetus to Community action in an area where a certain legislative acquis and fruitful cooperation with civil society exist .
that is the basis on which measures to combat discrimination have been adopted .
the proposals consist of two draft directives , covering discrimination in employment and discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , and an action programme intended to support the efforts of the Member States .
as regards the parallel directive on equal treatment irrespective of race or ethnic origin , the Council succeeded in reaching political agreement after the European Parliament revised its opinion on the issue .
we have therefore had to vote on the directive on equal treatment in employment and the 2001 / 2006 Action Programme .
to explain my votes , I would first say that the right to equal treatment and protection against discrimination is a fundamental human right .
but while this right has been recognised , it is very far from being converted into reality , hence the advantage of adopting determined and coordinated measures at European level .
as regards the Mann report on equal treatment in employment , I shall limit myself to emphasising my satisfaction that the grounds for derogation have been successfully reduced to the minimum .
otherwise the door would be opened to abuses contrary to the aim of this directive .
certain possibilities remain and I have to admit I am unhappy about them .
these are the grounds for derogation in matters of religion .
the provision for derogation on religious grounds on the basis of the notion of essential and direct occupational requirements carries the risk of broad interpretation .
as a confirmed secularist , I cannot associate myself with that .
similarly , I am concerned about the derogations authorised on the basis of age , as older people are particularly at risk of discrimination in relation to employment .
as regards the action programme to fight discrimination , the European Commission &apos; s proposal was broadly satisfactory .
there were some deplorable gaps and inaccuracies which have been corrected , with my support .
I felt it was essential to broaden the scope of the programme in order to ensure the implementation of Article 13 of the Treaty .
I am also very pleased that harassment will in future be regarded as a form of discrimination and that there is recognition that discrimination must be prevented , not just combated .
it was important to reaffirm the need to associate the candidate countries with this programme .
everyone is well aware of the problems faced by certain minorities in those countries .
my final comment relates to the budget for this programme , EUR 98.4 million . that figure is obviously inadequate given the actions envisaged .
in conclusion , I support the spirit of these proposals and I have voted for most of them , the exception being where they are in contradiction with my secularism .
the proposal for a directive on equal treatment in employment and occupation before us today is a response to a demand long expressed by the European Parliament , and our group in particular .
it is actually one of three parts of a package of measures on combating discrimination based on the new Article 13 , introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam , and includes a Community action programme .
these texts should , then , fill a glaring gap in the construction of Europe : recognition of the real needs of people excluded or marginalised in our societies because of disability , age , or membership of a minority .
the texts therefore represent some of the first steps towards the people &apos; s Europe that we have wanted for so long .
so , I enthusiastically support this proposal for a directive and the very positive amendments proposed by our rapporteur to improve its effectiveness .
in parallel , the amendment extending the exception to the principle of non-discrimination to the wider &apos; social &apos; activities of religious organisations , where the discrimination is solely based on religious conviction and on no other grounds , is a reinforcement of the specific nature and original contribution of these structures as compared with public or private services .
on the other hand , the amendments providing for penalties against companies infringing the principle of equal treatment by excluding them from public contracts seem to me both poorly adapted to the purpose and subject to divergent interpretation .
in addition , they open the door to distortions in competition between businesses in different European Union countries .
that is why I wish to express reservations on that point , while voting in favour of the text as a whole .
the SNP welcomes this directive and its aim to end discrimination in the workplace .
the unfair treatment of workers on the grounds of race , religious belief , disability , age or sexual orientation can in no way be justified in a modern and socially just Europe .
this directive gives Member States a great opportunity to enhance the rights of workers across the European Union .
the SNP is pleased to support this legislation , which is in line with our party &apos;s policies of ending discrimination in all its guises and of positively backing measures to ensure equality of treatment for all citizens .
moreover the SNP sees this legislation as a means to fulfil the underlying objectives of the European Union in recognising that equality in the field of employment helps combat social exclusion and assists the EU &apos;s aims of permitting the free movement of its citizens .
amendment No 18 : the directive under discussion concerns a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation and the over-generalised wording in Amendment No 18 is not relevant in all aspects to this directive .
it is manifestly clear from the justification for the amendment that the purpose is also to interfere in provisions on age that apply in Member States , which , in any case , are fully justified for reasons of psychological development , and they do not have any kind of impact in the job market .
for these reasons I voted against the amendment , although discrimination in employment and occupation in all its forms must be opposed .
amendment No 37 : the form the committee have proposed for Article 4.2 of this directive is good and could ensure there is a significant degree of continuity in the wider social activities of religious organisations , which is a basis for all European socio-political thinking , and is still an important part of its activity in practice .
in addition , the wording proposed by the committee reconfirms the vitality of the individual culture and customs of small , immigrant communities , among others .
for these reasons I voted in favour of the amendment .
our colleague , Thomas Mann , has invested a great deal of work in a report on the proposal for a Council directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation .
his report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
however , we then had 13 improvement amendments to consider , in addition to the 60 contained in the Mann report on the directive proposed by the Commission .
there is a saying we would do well not to ignore in our efforts to amend the Commission proposals , which are actually well thought through as a rule , and this is how it goes &apos; what is better is the enemy of what is good &apos; .
that is only common sense in fact .
one could not help but wonder if common sense had always prevailed in the drafting of certain , no doubt well-meaning , proposed amendments that were now before us .
if the directive is to be adopted and implemented , it must not be encumbered with a literary approach and wishful thinking , which have no place in a legal document .
that is most certainly true of the amendment which proposes that this directive should end the sexually discriminatory practice of stipulating that only male personnel can wear a tie .
if absurdity could kill then the authors of such an amendment would definitely no longer be with us .
I think it is also going too far to expect employers to provide statistics on all aspects of their employment of people falling within the scope of this directive .
the authorities already have their work cut out .
this brings to mind another sound rule of thumb : &apos; no one can achieve the impossible &apos; .
I also think that we can do without the entire contents of the new Article 12 ( a ) .
the Commission rightly refrained - on the basis of the subsidiarity principle , of course - from instructing the Member States to set up new institutions for monitoring the application of the principle of equal treatment , which could be consulted by every conceivable , and inconceivable , group of people or association etc , requesting free handling of their complaints , and which could even be granted access to confidential personnel files .
despite all the inconsistencies and superfluous proposals , which do nothing to help the cause , I did not want to vote against the report at the final vote .
but here too , I feel that &apos; less would have been more &apos; , and the Commission proposal , without the superfluous amendments , is the better and more logical instrument for ensuring equal treatment in employment and occupation , which is , after all , what we want .
I warmly welcome this proposal to establish a framework to combat discrimination and ensure equal treatment in employment .
the areas covered are access to employment and occupation , vocational training , promotion , employment conditions and membership of certain bodies .
the proposal covers both direct and indirect discrimination .
harassment is also included within the definition of discrimination .
with regard to disability , the principle of equal treatment entails the identification and removal of barriers in the way of persons with disabilities who , with reasonable accommodation , are able to perform the essential functions of a job .
while the proposal continues to allow differences of treatment on the grounds of age they have to be objectively justified .
the proposal also allows positive action to redress gender imbalance .
these proposals deserve the serious attention of the Member States and the other Community Institutions .
the EPLP has voted for the Mann report on equal treatment in discrimination because it is firmly committed to the principle of combating unjustified discrimination and is broadly supportive of the overall objectives behind this proposal .
however the EPLP has strong reservations about the following areas .
on disability , whilst we welcome the principle of the proposals , the UK are justly proud of our own disability discrimination legislation , but we do not want to impose our model on other Member States .
however , we do want to ensure the directive lets us continue with the approach in the disability discrimination Act , although we recognise that some relatively minor changes may be required .
on age , the EPLP welcomes the principle of fighting age discrimination in employment and training .
this is a very complex area and the proposals are far-reaching and ambitious .
however , we feel it is important that the Community has legislation which is clear and workable .
on religion / belief , the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection on these grounds .
for the UK this would end the anomaly whereby two non-major Christian groups ( Jews , Sikhs ) , receive protection both from direct and indirect discrimination under the UK Race Relations Act as they are recognised by the courts as ethnic groups as well as religious groups .
under some circumstances , Muslims receive protection , but only in cases of indirect discrimination , whilst Afro-Caribbean Muslims , white Muslims and indeed Christians , receive no protection at all .
however , the UK is one of the most religiously diverse populations in the European Union , so it is important that the proposals are right .
the EPLP is concerned to ensure that the directive will permit Section 60 of the UK Schools Standard and Framework Act 1998 to remain unaltered .
on sexual orientation , we welcome the principle of the Commission &apos;s proposals to fight discrimination on this ground .
further concerns :
much of the text will need further clarification before it is finalised .
we have concerns about the unclear definitions of &apos; reasonable accommodation &apos; and &apos; undue hardship &apos; in Article 2 ( 4 ) , and the possible contradiction with the public procurement directives in the amendment on Article 55 .
several areas of difference with the race directive should be eliminated , such as the definition of indirect discrimination in Amendment No 21 , the defence of rights in Article 8 , the text on victimisation in Article 10 , and Article 11 covering dissemination of information .
we also feel that the directive should be clear about which differences of treatment on the grounds of age are permissible and which are not .
we have concerns about several elements which appear to be overburdensome : notably application of the legislation to volunteer workers in charities and to public posts , and also compulsory collection and monitoring of statistics .
we are concerned about the inclusion of health , social security and assistance as there are considerable national differences in how these matters are handled and whether they form part of the employee / employer relationship .
there are also elements which , we feel , should be left to Member States such as overall implementation , provision of training to particular age groups of workers , the nature of a mediation system , and how SMEs are to interpret the directive .
finally , some elements should be permissive rather than mandatory to cater for different Member State practices .
we believe that the negations to come will provide an opportunity to tackle these issues and we look forward to enactment of the directive and the benefits it will bring to workers in the UK and other EU countries .
I voted against these reports because they enshrine within them the principle that sex perversion is elevated onto the level of holy marriage and sex only within the marriage bond .
they also discriminate against people and organisations who believe the Holy scriptures to be the word of God , the only infallible Rule of faith and practice , forcing such believers to employ those who propagate and practise acts of sex totally against the scriptural ethics .
it is on this issue alone that I voted no .
broadly speaking , the Christian Democrats welcome the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for employment equality .
however , we feel that the committee &apos; s amendment concerning statistics divided according to target group - i.e. based on the existing reasons for discrimination , such as race , ethnic origin , age , religion or belief , as well as sexual orientation - is far too great a violation of integrity .
we have therefore decided to vote against this amendment , but we support the report as such .
report Van Hulten ( A5-0260 / 2000 )
I have abstained on the van Hulten report because I do not think we should increase the number of controlling authorities within the European institutions .
this &apos; control frenzy &apos; actually leads to officials being freed from responsibility , to a situation where everyone tries to palm off responsibility on the controllers , and the controllers of the controllers .
the European Union suffers from a bad image among many citizens .
rapporteur Van Hulten expressed the following view in an interview with a Dutch weekly magazine , &quot; It is called Europe , it is in Brussels and is corrupt . &quot;
thanks to the action taken by a &quot; whistle blower &quot; and the Committee of Wise Men , corruption has been brought out into the open .
in the interview , Mr Van Hulten is right in saying that we will not be able to draft a positive agenda until we have solved problems such as fraud , waste , but also a lack of efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making .
the financial reform , more specifically the establishment of an internal audit department , is conducive to the European Union &apos; s effectiveness .
rapporteur Van Hulten is right in filling in the gaps in the Commission proposal : what is needed is a clear definition of the distribution of responsibilities between financial control and internal audit .
but if Mr Van Hulten would like to dedicate himself to an efficient and effective Union , we , along with the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets , cannot see why he should exempt smaller institutions , such as the Committee of the Regions , from internal audit duty .
this view is at the expense of transparency of the financial regulation .
naturally the number of transactions in the smaller institutions is smaller than in the large ones - the 800 000 transactions performed annually in the Commission eclipse the 10 000 transactions performed annually in the Committee of the Regions .
but this only says something about the staffing levels of the internal audit department and nothing about the financial significance and hence usefulness of such a department .
this is the reason why I have applied for split voting on Amendment No 3 . in this way , it will still be possible to include the obligation of an internal audit department in the proposal .
although the rapporteur shares my view that all institutions must be given equal treatment , he would like to postpone this equal treatment until the definitive review of the financial regulation in eighteen months &apos; time .
in my view , if the opportunity presents itself to step up efficiency within the EU institutions , each day that passes while we are waiting is one too many .
to set up an internal audit office in the institutions will naturally require effort , but that effort will remain the same , whether it is made now or in the future .
the image of Europe is not served by the efficient operation of the large EU institutions alone ; in many respects , it is probably the small ones that make all the difference .
report Titley ( A5-0211 / 2000 )
I am sure , in common with all my colleagues , we support the proper management and control of arms exports in the European Union .
we have many examples of how uncontrolled and unscrupulous arms exports have exacerbated many of the conflicts in the past century and even into the present time .
we , in Europe , along with our colleagues across the globe , have to see that the mistakes and greed of the past are not repeated .
the reasons of my vote on this report relate , in the main , to the question of closer European Union relations with NATO and also the onward rush to a common defence policy .
many will speak about peace and conflict resolution while at the same time will be making deals to sell arms to combatants .
if this two-faced policy were stopped then many of the difficulties could be overcome .
as stated at the outset , I am in favour of greater control over arms exports , but this issue should not be confused with other political initiatives .
even if we sympathise with the idea of regulating the European production and export of arms politically , we are sceptical about the Titley report , mainly for the following reasons .
there is no link between the development of the arms industry and EU cooperation in the area of military policy .
the EU has decided to develop a joint military capacity in order to fulfil the so-called Petersberg objectives ( crisis management and conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU ) , but it has no common defence policy .
the individual EU countries are members of NATO and the WEU , or else are non-aligned .
policy on arms exports must start from that point , and a distinction must be made between supervising an arms industry developed for political reasons ( namely crisis management ) and arms exports for purely commercial reasons . in our view , such exports ought to be kept to a minimum and , in the long term , completely abolished .
we welcome the initiative for codes of conduct for arms exports .
many of Mr Titley &apos; s proposals and comments in the report represent improvements to the Council &apos; s original report .
nonetheless , we have decided to vote against Mr Titley &apos; s report for the following reasons :
the report means continued recognition of the importance of a strong European military capacity instead of placing the emphasis on the need for disarmament and peace .
the report sees arms export controls primarily as a method of avoiding awkward situations for Europe &apos; s military industry and not as a way of achieving disarmament and peace .
moreover , the report discusses European arms exports as a way of solving future local conflicts in the immediate vicinity of Europe .
despite the request from the Group of the Greens , the rapporteur has also consistently failed to discuss Turkey which , through its membership of NATO , is in practice excluded from the codes of conduct .
the report also means that Europe &apos; s war industry is regarded as an economically important industry , and that is an indefensible perspective on an industry whose primary task is implicitly to kill and annihilate people .
as long as the European Parliament is unable to make the logical connection between the production and sale of arms and the continued global military destruction of the environment and human life , we cannot support reports such as this .
support this report from my colleague , Gary Titley , and agree with him that responsible arms trade practices form part of the &quot; acquis communautaire &quot; and therefore candidate countries should be actively involved in the further development of the Code of Conduct on arms exports and that this should be legally binding .
I particularly share his view that there is a need to establish common rules and effective EU controls to combat illegal arms trafficking and to control the legal trade in small arms and light weapons .
I trust the Member States will give this considered and early attention .
the world would be a safer place without weapons .
I am therefore in favour of a code of conduct which renders it impossible to produce and export arms and which results in arms factories switching over to the production of useful commodities .
from this perspective , I have read Mr Titley &apos; s proposals and examined to what extent his text contributes to a world of peace without weapons .
in general terms , I endorse the small steps forward , even if they do not , by any means , completely lead to the solutions put forward by myself .
it is a different matter if such a small step forward puts a spanner in the works when it comes to reaching real solutions .
I believe that the choice today is not between complete freedom in the arms trade and this code of conduct .
if these were the two options , I would endorse the code of conduct as the lesser of the two evils , the underlying rationale being that something is better than nothing .
however , the real choice is between this code of conduct and a complete ban .
the code of conduct is based on the assumption that the arms trade will continue to exist and that European arms production must be promoted .
the excrescences are being regulated because it is they that draw attention and instil indignation .
the issue of the arms trade itself remains out of range .
to me , this is a reason not to support the code of conduct .
- ( SV ) It is good that the European Union wishes to implement a code of conduct to restrict arms exports .
however , I cannot accept the introduction of the requirement of a common defence policy and a European security and defence policy within NATO .
Sweden is neutral and does not intend to enter into any defence alliance .
consequently , I cannot support these viewpoints , expressed either in Recital R or in paragraphs 1 c , 1 d and 1 e .
France , Germany and Great Britain , together with the USA , are the main arms dealers feeding the planet &apos; s conflicts : in Africa , where 10 states are at war , and in Asia , between India and Pakistan .
the European states have sold arms to Indonesia , whose army is implicated in the massacres in Timor and the Moluccas .
France is selling helicopters to Turkey , which is waging war against the Kurdish people , and aircraft to China and Taiwan , not to mention the scandal of the famous Taiwan frigates .
in the recent past , France was an accomplice to the genocide in Rwanda by delivering any amount of small arms to the regime perpetrating the massacres .
no one has yet insisted that the European Union and France answer for that .
the resolution is not seeking to reduce arms sales radically to promote a policy of disarmament , but just to regulate them in order to guarantee greater profits for the industrial groups .
there is no such thing as a bloodless war .
there are only wars that kill .
this hypocritical resolution seeks the implementation of a &apos; European code of conduct &apos; while simultaneously declaring that the defence industry is &apos; economically and strategically important for the EU &apos; .
we take the view that the restructuring of the defence industry should not be motivated by the political ambition to create a common defence policy , but by the strategic and industrial requirements of the major companies and Member States involved .
on this basis , link-ups between European and North American companies are as much to be welcomed as between European companies .
while we can support a code of conduct which sets out a level playing field with a set of rules to which we can all voluntarily adhere , we do not wish to encumber industry with more unnecessary regulations .
in particular , we do not support the proposal , in Paragraph 9 of the resolution , that the code of conduct should be made legally binding .
while there is much that we can agree with in this resolution there are a number of fundamental flaws and this is why we have abstained in our vote .
report Angelilli ( A5-0258 / 2000 )
children are the first victims of violence on television .
we all now recognise the impact and the harm which the daily and increasing bombardment of violent television programmes and similar multimedia products wreaks on young people , who are less discerning because their critical faculties are not fully developed .
the Commission text and the report contain a number of accurate findings as regards the adverse impact on the psychological makeup and developing personality of children and , consequently , on the dangers in store for tomorrow &apos; s society as the result of their watching these programmes and using these products .
however , their proposals are confined to watersheds and programme classification and , in adopting the Oxford University report on television programme filtering devices , which parents have to buy before they can use them to protect their children , are targeted specifically at digital and subscriber television .
once again , the delicate and sensitive issue of the protection of our children , i.e. the members of tomorrow &apos; s society , are being hijacked by commercialisation and the profit motive .
the entire onus of protecting children is on the parents and the question of the actual production and broadcasting of programmes which are harmful to children is hardly even touched on .
and , assuming that they can afford these filtering devices , how are parents supposed to protect their children from so-called children &apos; s programmes , the majority of which contain scenes of violence and some of which are scarier than horror films ?
and how are they supposed to protect them from the violence which inundates multimedia products and the Internet ?
the only reference to companies is to do with a code of self-regulation .
we do agree with a number of interesting proposals on protecting children in the Angelilli report , such as the need for a detailed study into the moral and legal aspects of the protection of minors .
I have today voted against Roberta Angelilli &apos; s report on the communication from the Commission on an investigation concerning parental control of television broadcasting .
if I do so , it is not because I am opposed to the report as such but because I should like to send a clear signal to the effect that the EU and the Commission should concentrate on their core tasks .
it is not a task for the EU but for the Member States to take initiatives in this area .
there are enough other pressing tasks for the Commission to expend its energies on .
as the father of two small children , I have taken a particular interest in the results of the study on parental control of television broadcasting .
I am delighted this study has been completed .
the legal and ethical framework does indeed vary from one Member State to another in line with national traditions and culture .
there is no single European definition of a minor nor is there full agreement on what is or is not harmful to minors watching certain television programmes .
everyone agrees , however , that it is in the public interest to make a decisive stand against the wave of violence and other content dangerous to young people which is flooding television programmes and audiovisual services transmitted via networks , in order to protect the psychological balance of minors .
minors are different from adults .
they are more vulnerable , less able to exercise critical judgement and at greater risk of being disturbed .
like the rapporteur , I believe measures intended to protect young people from violent and harmful programmes should not be limited to traditional television but should apply to all media .
I also think it is essential to put the emphasis on teaching children media skills .
so there is a need to strengthen national and regional awareness-raising campaigns on the protection of minors in the media context , involving families and the education world .
also , television programme filtering devices must be sold at prices affordable to all .
at the same time , such measures obviously do not imply that the service providers should in any way be relieved of all responsibility for the content they broadcast .
given that issues linked to radio and television are the responsibility of the Member States , I support the request made to them that they and the Commission lay down in law the responsibilities incumbent on the media companies .
I also think it is essential for European Union television operators to draw up a code of self-regulation for the protection of minors .
I end by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work .
I welcome the main provisions of this report , which highlights once again the importance that the European Parliament attaches to the protection of our young children in Europe .
this report confirms that it is in the public interest to protect children from viewing excessive television violence and other programmes that may produce harmful effects .
the subject of this report is both highly specific and highly complex .
any further analysis of specific technology such as filtering systems will have to take account of the advances in technology which are evident today .
this report is based on the principle of common sense .
it is premised on the need for television broadcasting to take responsibility for the protection of minors by means of a self-regulatory code which should apply throughout the European Union .
a committee of experts will also be constituted at a European Community level with the mandate of drawing up a memorandum setting out general principles for the protection of minors in the media context .
it is now incumbent on the European Commission and the European Parliament and all interested parties to work together to see how best young people can be protected from viewing excessive television violence .
I would hope that the key television broadcasting organisations , both from the private and the public sector within the European Union , will engage positively in this process .
certainly we must recognise that technology is changing rapidly within the television sector within Europe .
digitalisation of old analogue television networks is taking place across the length and breadth of the participating Member States of the EU .
this , too , will lead to greater challenges for legislators to put in place the necessary protective measures to guarantee that young children are protected from viewing wholly violent and inappropriate television programmes .
I will be working closely at national European level to ensure that EU governments implement the necessary legislation to put in place the necessary protective mechanisms which I have addressed .
TV is now an essential part of daily life .
with viewing averaging three hours per day , it is the most extensive human activity after sleep and - for adults - work .
changes at work , like more working women and more flexible hours , mean children are increasingly left alone with the small screen .
there are various solutions , but none is satisfactory .
a self-regulation code for professionals is an excellent solution , however .
I feel that this is the right direction .
as the rapporteur has stressed , parental control must not end with TV .
children are also great consumers of the Internet and video games .
the approach must include all forms of image transmission .
she spells out the difficulties of operating at Community level , when every Member State has its own history and its own special relationship with its national television . individual cultural features are reflected in the content of programmes .
I also support the amendments from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party which contribute useful details on &apos; who does what &apos; .
I should like to congratulate Mrs Angelilli on the proposals in her report on developing control mechanisms to protect children from watching violent and other broadcasts which are unsuitable for their age .
under these circumstances , it is essential that all the Member States comply with Community legislation as quickly as possible .
furthermore , I have ascertained from a personal investigation in the relevant Commission services that eight Member States ( Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Finland , Portugal , Sweden , Spain and the UK ) are applying Community legislation , while the rest ( France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , the Netherlands and Luxembourg ) are infringing it one way or another .
I also agree with my fellow Member that these measures should not be confined solely to television and should also apply to the Internet , which no longer has any reason to &quot; envy &quot; television , now that its multiple applications include film projections .
if all these proposals are to be translated from theory into practice , we need to create filtering and classification mechanisms which allow parents to select the programmes which are suitable for their children .
encouraging industry to move in this direction through international collaboration and increasing parents &apos; , teachers &apos; and children &apos; s awareness will act as a catalyst .
report Dybkjær ( A5-0198 / 2000 )
this third annual report on equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union sets out the highlights and successes of the year 1998 .
it must be said that although equality between women and men has been proclaimed by law , the facts are there to remind us that the discrimination and difficulties women face unfortunately persist .
women are the most vulnerable to unemployment .
the 1998 report makes a special study of the phenomenon of unemployment and the economic impact of under-employment of women .
it also analyses the measures taken to incorporate employment policies strictly focused on women or policies to restrict gender discrimination in employment , for example , in employment contracts , types of employment and remuneration .
moreover , women are often in &apos; flexible &apos; jobs ; temporary contracts and low salaries are typical in sectors where women employees are in a majority .
women &apos; s careers are often unstable , and they can only acquire experience with difficulty .
that situation is often illustrated by low levels of social protection and precarious living conditions .
women are also over-represented in &apos; typically female &apos; occupations but under-represented in jobs with responsibility and in the professions .
furthermore , women are not as well represented as men in rapidly growing sectors such as information and communications technologies , with women tending to occupy the lowest level in the hierarchy .
it is therefore crucial to restore balance by establishing education and training policies specifically geared to young women .
gender disparity is also prevalent when it comes to wages and salaries . figures available for 1995 show that for the European Union as a whole , the hourly wage for a woman is only 73 % of that for a man doing equal work .
I therefore fully support the rapporteur in urging the Commission to pursue its efforts and in particular to strengthen the &apos; strategic &apos; nature of its annual reports , by assessing the effectiveness of policy initiatives rather than contenting itself with describing them .
I also think it is necessary to stress that Community standards of respect for women &apos; s rights and equal opportunities should be implemented in the candidate countries even before they join .
finally , I invite the Member States to pursue the dual strategy advocated at Community level , involving mainstreaming and specific actions for women .
Interestingly , this is the first time that the need for the Commission &apos; s annual reports to go further in its evaluation of the efficacy of political initiatives has been identified .
what we have before us is a motion which , although not lacking in proposals for studies and research , stops well short of a real approach which will highlight crucial problems not yet resolved and the new problems which are beginning to threaten existing rights and achievements , together with their real causes .
women are still one of the most vulnerable sections of society , whose rights are rudely trampled underfoot by the current social and economic system .
that is what we should have acknowledged first , then we would not have had such a knee-jerk report singing praises and dispensing declarations of intent .
equal opportunities at work , equal social participation , equality in health and elsewhere are impossible within a framework of reactionary policies offensive to human dignity as a whole , without equal social prospects , in a society of unemployment and underemployment , with no welfare state , a society in which human values are costed and commercialised .
social rights and social achievements are not expanding ; on the contrary , they are increasingly being eroded on the grounds that they are too expensive .
they are the first to fall foul of cuts in public spending , privatisation of the health sector , the right to health care and medical attention - never mind the right to prevention and information programmes .
they work in conditions which are bad for their physical , mental and spiritual health , conditions which affect women more than men because they have to juggle so many duties and take on double and triple social roles .
even the report acknowledges that , &quot; In addition to their general failure to substantiate the impact of policies and programmes , the reports also fail to discuss the factors behind continuing inequality . &quot;
how can progress in resolving women &apos; s problems and offering them institutional protection against all forms of discrimination be planned and strengthened within the framework of a social and economic system which commercialises and subjects everything to the rigours of public financial policy and the quest for greater profit ?
a policy of fundamental protection for women cannot be implemented unless we redirect and radically restructure our social development model .
in the face of plans and practices to exploit and oppress , in the face of discriminatory tactics , we call on women to enforce and claim their demands together with men within the framework of a wide grass-roots battle front in each individual country .
although it has some positive points , this motion merely skirts round the problem .
we fear that its proclamations and good intentions are , yet again , no more than &apos; lame excuses &apos; .
that concludes the vote .

topical and urgent debate
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Peru
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0777 / 2000 , by Mr Medina Ortega and others , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the crisis in Peru ;
B5-0780 / 2000 , by Mr Di Pietro , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the situation in Peru ;
B5-0784 / 2000 , by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on the crisis in Peru ;
B5-0790 / 2000 , by Mr Lipietz and Mr Nogueira Román , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on the crisis in Peru ;
B5-0792 / 2000 , by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on the crisis in Peru .
Mr President , I have here a speech I gave on 9 April 1992 , in which I referred to the coup , the so-called self-inflicted coup , by President Fujimori , and at the time I said that it was not acceptable for a democratically elected president to relinquish his legitimacy by relying on the armed forces .
since the last electoral farce , Fujimori has lost his legitimacy and not only that , but he has lost the political support that he previously had .
at the moment , the question that arises is the future of Peru , of knowing whether the country will be able to get out of the difficult situation in which Mr Fujimori has now placed it .
various political groups have presented a joint draft resolution in which we basically ask President Fujimori to go , but to do so in such a way that , through a process of clean and democratic elections , democracy can be consolidated in that country .
secondly , we ask the institutions of the European Union to help the democratic process in Peru , which is something that they are capable of doing .
we are also asking for a delegation from the European Parliament to go to Peru in order to monitor the development of events on the ground .
we hope that Fujimori does not make things worse , that he makes this transition possible and that in Peru there will not be the same situation as there currently is in Belgrade , with a popular uprising that is practically on the streets .
therefore , I think that if the European institutions and the European Parliament help the Peruvian people at this difficult time , we could contribute to the stability of the country and to the consolidation of democratic institutions across Latin America .
Mr President , Peru is currently going through a period of uncertainty , and we all cherish the hope that the current situation will be resolved through a process in which all civil and political rights are guaranteed , which will help to strengthen and consolidate democracy and peace in Peru , a country that has suffered 25 000 deaths in the last fifteen years .
also , the European Union must , with maximum care , invite all the Peruvian democratic forces to take part in dialogue in order to achieve commitments guaranteeing the exercise of civil and public rights and freedom of expression .
Mr President , we are delighted to have confirmation of what we predicted in a recent vote .
the European Parliament firmly rejected the election of Mr Fujimori and I am pleased to see honourable Members in the two main groups committing themselves clearly to strong European Parliament support for establishing democracy in Peru .
but we are concerned about the fate of Mr Montesinos .
the right of asylum cannot be used to protect criminals .
the whole world rejoiced when the international resolutions finally began to work against one former dictator , Mr Pinochet .
Mr Montesinos cannot be allowed to find refuge in Panama or , as some rumours are beginning to suggest , in Morocco .
he should be brought to trial on the grounds of torture , drug-trafficking and the rest by any state where he seeks refuge .
Mr President , the Peruvian people &apos; s desire for peace , democracy , justice and well-being is coming closer to being realised with the resignation of Mr Fujimori .
the adverse effect that North American backing for him has had on those desires must be neutralised by another influence , a positive influence in favour of human rights and full democratic progress , coming from the European Union .
for this reason , we feel it is necessary to highlight two aspects of the joint resolution that we are presenting .
the first aspect is that the European Union should deny asylum - and not negotiate with other countries either - to a figure such as Montesinos , who is responsible for terrible crimes against humanity .
the second is that a delegation should be sent from the European Parliament to Peru with the purpose of assessing the prospects for democratic progress and for peacefully overcoming the present problems , so that our contribution will be a very positive one .
Mr President , I would prefer it if , for once , we could have a debate on Latin America following well-prepared discussions in the committees , rather than it being part of some urgent procedure or other .
it seems to me that we only ever deal with events in Latin America on a case by case basis , but otherwise pursue a very reticent policy .
it is a shame , because the continent merits more attention .
as far as Peru is concerned , a number of speakers , and also our resolution , have pointed to the fact that President Fujimori &apos; s forthcoming resignation offers scope for a fresh start .
I am not so sure whether this will be the case though , because there have already been one or two disturbing developments on this front , and I will only be convinced once Fujimori has actually stepped down or been voted out of office .
I therefore think it is extremely important for the European Union to get fully involved with this country , and with the situation in Peru , for example by maintaining an orderly dialogue with the forces of opposition .
I would like us to send the delegation that we wanted to send to the elections - which then failed to take place for reasons we are all familiar with - to Peru now , with a view to supporting those who are working towards democratic reform in the country .
and if that were to be the outcome of this afternoon &apos; s sitting , I would be more than satisfied .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that the events in Peru are evidence of the world of difference that there can be between the formal meaning of words and their tangible weight .
the term in question is the word &apos; democracy &apos; .
Peru has a parliament which has been elected by universal suffrage and a president who has used the powers of persuasion of the army to violate all constitutional precepts .
I feel that this resolution marks a key point in Parliament &apos;s political initiative .
I would like to focus briefly on one of the subjects covered by the report : the call for Parliament to send a delegation .
the European Union has got to do something and do it quickly .
the process of democracy needs to be consolidated , but consolidated with political instruments and human resources .
we must ensure that , when Peru reaches its goal , it has candidates who are capable of rising to the challenge and responding to the Peruvian people &apos;s demand for political renewal and genuine democracy .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is why I strongly support the call for Parliament to send a delegation , not just to act as a witness should something go badly wrong , but , for once in its history , to support a country which is seeking a democratic way forward .
Mr President , the need for the resolution on the situation in Peru has made two things clear .
the first is our frustration at having to return to the vigilance over democracy and human rights in Latin America , which was of major concern to Parliament in the 1980s and which diminished in the 1990s with the emergence of democratic governments in most countries there .
it is also frustrating because , in addition to the situation in Peru , other attempts at aggressive populism are creating appalling dictatorships , which confirm our worst fears and mean that we must target Latin America once again in our vigilance over democracy .
let us be quite frank : this resolution highlights the feeling that Europe &apos; s influence on that sub-continent has weakened .
Europe felt that its conscience no longer required it to intervene after the switch to democracy in the 1990s and did little for those countries , apart from giving advice on models of economic integration .
opening up our markets was symbolic - with the exception of beef from Argentina , because of BSE as we know - but there was very little technology transfer , cultural and political relations existed in name only , and career training and investments in added value made little progress .
Europe did not take the opportunity provided by the fledgling democracies to promote development and social justice in Latin America to help these countries to break their almost exclusive dependence on accumulating capital , which is based on drug trafficking .
the situation with Peru and Mr Fujimori has not yet degenerated into a disaster , Mr President . there are signs of disillusionment and the situation should serve , for the moment , as a warning .
in order to avert a disaster , it is absolutely crucial that Europe takes its politics to the American sub-continent as well .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the conditions under which elections were held in Peru in May this year , were unacceptable .
against this background , the Commission gave its support to the Organisation of American States , whose brief is to monitor a range of significant democratic reforms that the government and opposition had agreed on .
the European Union emphasised only very recently , in a declaration , that President Fujimori had seized the initiative with his decision to call fresh elections .
this initiative could prove to be an important step in the direction of democracy , but only if he refrains from employing the tactics that he has announced he is going to use in these elections .
if this opportunity is to be made use of , a whole range of serious shortcomings are going to have to be overcome .
these are shortcomings that became apparent during the previous elections .
if these weaknesses are not dealt with , there is a risk that the next elections will be extremely dubious too .
the Commission therefore supports the Organisation of American States in the continuation of its work as per the schedule agreed at the time , and this notwithstanding the difficult conditions and numerous imponderables that weigh heavily on these forthcoming new elections .
the Commission , in tandem with the Member States , is currently examining how we can best help , in practical terms , in the preparation of these plural and democratic elections , and , if need be , as observers of the process .
thank you , Commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 6.00 p.m .
Afghanistan
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0776 / 2000 , by Mr van den Berg and Mr Sakellariou , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the situation in Afghanistan ;
B5-0778 / 2000 , by Mr Dupuis and others , on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members , on the situation in Afghanistan ;
B5-0781 / 2000 , by Mrs Dybkjær and Mrs Malmström , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the situation in Afghanistan ;
B5-0785 / 2000 , by Mr Morillon , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on the situation in Afghanistan ;
B5-0789 / 2000 , by Mrs Schroedter and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on the situation in Afghanistan ;
B5-0793 / 2000 , by Mrs Ainardi and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on the position of women in Afghanistan .
Mr President , I think we owe a great deal to the man behind this resolution , General Morillon .
it is an important resolution because Afghanistan and its desperately suffering people , and especially its children who are blown up by mines and its women who face appalling discrimination , deserve far more attention from us .
thanks to this motion for a resolution , which has found broad consensus , Parliament is taking a firm position .
as the resolution states , the fundamental political challenge is to put pressure on Afghanistan &apos; s large neighbour , Pakistan , as a means of trying to influence the situation in Afghanistan , I would also add the other large neighbour , the People &apos; s Republic of China , with which Pakistan has excellent relations and collaborates at military and nuclear level .
we also know that there is extensive cooperation between those two big countries , Pakistan and the People &apos; s Republic of China , at the level of the political nomenklatura and the local mafia as regards drug trafficking .
we know Afghanistan is not far away , and we know it is the world &apos; s largest producer of opiates , so we can well imagine the role played by these political mafias , which are not necessarily simply political , in the expansion of the drug trade .
we also know that the policy of the United Nations , especially that of UNDCP and Mr Arlacchi , is a disaster . despite the millions of dollars invested in Afghanistan in the course of the last few years , production has doubled .
to summarise , I think pressure needs to be exerted on Pakistan and the People &apos; s Republic of China , all funding needs to be withdrawn from Mr Arlacchi and UNDCP so that these prohibitionist policies on drugs do not end up encouraging production and trade in drugs , because that is what is happening now .
Mr President , earlier in the day we had a debate about the rights of women in the European Union , and we also touched upon the question of the new candidate countries .
in facing a decision like this about the Taliban regime , it has to be said that it has really been a luxury , purely and simply , to discuss the other issues , when one considers what is happening in Afghanistan .
ever since I first heard about the Taliban regime , I have been appalled .
I find it completely incredible that such things can still be going on in the year 2000 , and not only do we not intervene , but we cannot , in reality , do a vast amount about them .
in war , there will clearly always be a large number of innocent people who suffer distress or die , and very often it is , of course &apos; women and children and old people who are totally defenceless in a wide range of situations .
what is happening here , however , is in fact even worse .
it is a far more systematic form of oppression than is to be seen in normal war situations .
it is far more systematic and far more violent in relation to a particular group of women .
it appears as if it is simply a question of groups of men who find themselves in a world in which nothing else counts but their own solidarity and their own oppression of women .
I therefore also think it good that the decision should include some clear and explicit points about the position of women in particular and should draw attention to how necessary it is for us to try to help prevent the Taliban regime from continuing with its wholesale discrimination against women .
is Afghanistan condemned to sink back into the dark ages and suffocate slowly under the Taliban yoke , in the image of its women under the weight of the obligatory chador ?
how many more deaths and displaced persons do there have to be to pierce the veil of our political indifference ?
how many more tons of drugs injected into the veins of young people worldwide must we deplore ?
must we wait until state terrorism is fully established , wait for the victory of Jihad , the application of the expansionist will of religious fanatics to the whole region , before we Members of the European Union finally agree to get involved , as is our duty ?
the long offensive carried on by the Taliban , with quite open support from Pakistan , is now cutting off the peoples of the Northern Alliance from a supply route essential to their survival .
the international community can no longer content itself with burying its head in the sand , and conducting &apos; wait-and-see &apos; diplomacy .
I think I speak for many people here when I declare our rejection of a comfortable neutrality , making a theory out of passivity and justifying blindness .
we protest at the sort of neutrality that tends to put the protagonists on the same level , stacking the daily atrocities of the Taliban regime on the same shelf as the armed resistance of commander Massoud .
Massoud is seen as a war leader , but how could it be otherwise after so many battles ?
but for those who know him and have seen him at work , he is also a man of dialogue and unification .
he sees himself as the champion of a tolerant Islam .
he can be a man of peace .
Massoud insists that there is no military solution to the Afghan problem .
he is right . we must act urgently to find political solutions which respect the values underpinning our Union .
that is the thrust of the resolution drafted by all the groups , which I have the honour of defending here .
essentially it calls on the Council Presidency to bring its influence to bear to put an end to foreign interference in that country .
it calls on the Commission to take stock of the humanitarian aid measures intended for the Afghan population so that this aid reaches everyone .
finally it insists , and this is the essential point , that the European Union coordinate its initiatives with those of neighbouring countries to impose a solution whereby peace , stability , and respect for international law and the most elementary human rights can be re-established .
we are well aware that this will not be an easy task , but here I would like to quote the motto of a great European , William of Orange : &quot; hope is not necessary to engagement , nor success to perseverance . &quot;
Mr President , Afghanistan has the worst human rights record in the world , both in terms of the number and the severity of the violations committed .
the predicament of Afghan women is a particularly apt case in point .
women cannot go to work , girls cannot go to school , women cannot walk freely down the street , and they are stoned , to name but a few examples .
there is not a single human rights organisation working in Afghanistan .
it is the country that has the most mines .
it is a country where there is no hope for the children .
75 % of the boys and 90 % of the girls do not go to school .
it is one of the poorest countries and there is a forgotten war going on .
I feel this all goes to show just how important this resolution is .
on balance , it is clear that the international organisations and the UN are not doing enough as matters stand .
in other words , the conflict is far more complex , there is no solution in the offing and yet , as we all agree , there is an urgent need for one .
the EU has an important task before it in this respect .
it could bring its ideas on non-military conflict management to bear .
there are a few examples I could mention : the monitoring of weapons exports and small arms through to the end-user , so that we do not secretly aid and abet the conflict out there , support for non-governmental organisations and women &apos; s organisations based there , which are courageous enough to take action despite the hopelessness of the situation .
in particular , in light of the above , it is absolutely imperative that the Member States grant asylum to all those who flee Afghanistan , as a matter of course .
it would do the EU &apos; s image no harm at all if it were to get a political initiative off the ground in the United Nations , with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in Afghanistan .
Mr President , the recent Taliban offensives must obviously concern us .
terrible suffering has been caused by this conflict .
I , too , support the joint resolution , of course .
but I want to join previous speakers in emphasising two concerns .
the first issue is the position of women .
it is not something we can get used to it .
we must never trivialise it .
they still endure appalling conditions : they are denied access to work , health care and education .
they live in destitution and permanent insecurity .
they are regularly victims of stonings .
they are suppressed in the true sense of the word .
all Afghan women , whatever their age , are faced with systematic violation of their most fundamental rights .
that is why I also believe they should be entitled to the right of asylum .
the European Union must renew its solidarity with all Afghan women in their struggle at home and abroad against the Taliban regime .
the second issue is that the Taliban are clearly seeking international recognition , on the grounds that they now control virtually all of Afghanistan .
so peace , stability and respect for rights can only be re-established through a political solution .
greater involvement of the European Union is definitely needed .
and in that search , I believe it is vital for the Council to reinforce the restrictions it has decided on .
there can be no recognition by any Member State , as long as Afghanistan maintains its policy of violation of human rights , notably its systematic discrimination against women .
the Commission should also take much stronger emergency humanitarian measures for the people , doing everything possible to enable the NGOs to provide aid to Afghan women and involve them in their activities .
Mr President , today , just as and even more so than in the past , the tragic military success of the Taliban has meant that hundreds of thousands of women are subject to severe repression and are denied medical assistance , education , the possibility of supporting themselves and the freedom of movement .
around a million people , most of them children , have been mutilated by anti-personnel mines .
the urgent resolution to be put to the vote today calls for the concerns voiced by Parliament on many occasions to be translated into further practical initiatives .
there is one point which I must stress in particular .
there has been a budget heading for the funding of mine clearance and prevention programmes for many years now .
funding has been allocated for 2000 and will be provided for 2001 as well .
we need to take immediate action to prevent thousands of children inadvertently triggering tragic explosions while they are playing in the fields , and receiving disabling wounds .
we can do this . the operations have been endorsed and are viable , but the funding is being held up by bureaucracy , by the need to assess previous actions and by confusion over the responsibilities of the different departments .
ladies and gentlemen of the Commission , look up from your texts , find out what is going on outside the realm of documents : thousands of children are in danger .
rise above sluggishness and uncertainty .
yes , carry out all the assessments you want to , but , in the meantime , let the funds for 2000 reach their destination and you will be saving the lives and preventing the mutilation of a great many unfortunate people .
Mr President , maybe it is not useful or politically correct to point out who supported the Taliban at the start , when they were aiming to achieve the power that they now have in Afghanistan .
and we do need to take this into account in the European institutions , as well as the fact that drug cultivation is used to buy arms .
this morning - and I will shortly conclude , Mr President - a code of conduct was approved on the sale and trafficking of arms .
I do not think that this code will be useful unless it is effective in preventing weapons from reaching the hands of people who are committing very serious violations against human rights , as these people are .
Mr President , we all know by now that we should not entertain any illusions with regard to the nature of the present regime in Kabul .
we only have to cast our minds back to the events in Afghanistan this summer .
the Taliban launched a new military attack on their northern opponents in the middle of the worst drought this poor country has had since time immemorial .
this drought has resulted in a drop in harvest by an estimated 2.3 million tonnes of food .
this essentially renders a quarter of the total Afghan population dependent on grain supplies from the World Food Programme .
it was in just such a tragic situation that the country &apos; s radical Islamic rulers revolted against the UN &apos; s so-called bread programme in the capital of Kabul .
this was a project that was due to benefit 28 000 war widows , no less .
the Taliban &apos; s excuse ?
there are countless bakeries which offer employment to women .
despite this - at least in western eyes - inhumane policy , the Taliban is seeking international diplomatic recognition .
they seize on cooperation in the return of millions of Afghan refugees , sponsored by the United Nations , as official global acceptance of their unbearable tyranny .
it remains very much to be seen whether this religious barbarism is really sufficient for us to form a closed international containment front against the hosts of Jihad conspirator , Osama bin laden .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the current intensification in the armed conflict between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance is extremely disturbing .
increasing numbers of people are fleeing from the fighting .
some sources put the number of displaced people at 90 000 .
many of these are now seeking sanctuary in makeshift camps in the mountains in the north-east of the country .
the conditions there could go badly downhill when winter sets in .
in the light of this development , ECHO , the Commission agency for humanitarian aid , is currently working hard to put together a package of emergency aid to the value of EUR 3 million , in order to support these displaced people with medical supplies , food , and the means to get through the winter .
in addition , ECHO has already made EUR 5.7 million available this year for the victims of drought in Afghanistan , for mine clearance in the north of the country and for the resettlement of refugees .
the victims of drought are also due to receive a further EUR 3 million .
I would like to take the opportunity to say , in response to Mrs Paciotti &apos; s comment , that naturally I will not hesitate to inquire within the Commission today as to what has become of the funding for mine clearance and what is going to become of it .
should I find that there are bureaucratic stumbling blocks here , as you put it , then you have my word that I will do all I can to overcome these obstacles with all speed .
the honourable Members are well aware that the Commission has a long-term commitment to the Afghan refugees and those who have been displaced within Afghanistan itself .
between 1991 and 2000 , the Commission made a total of EUR 400 million available for refugee aid , humanitarian emergency aid and food aid .
a significant slice of this was earmarked for mine clearance and associated information campaigns conducted by UN agencies , European or Afghan non-governmental organisations .
with its common position on Afghanistan , the European Union is supporting the United Nations &apos; special mission in Afghanistan , and the efforts to achieve peace undertaken by the General Secretary &apos; s special representatives .
the Union has resolved to make an effective contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in the country , and it is as plain as day that this will not come about until human rights and fundamental values are given full recognition .
accordingly , the common position roundly condemns the ongoing discrimination against women in Afghanistan and other human rights violations that take place there .
as long as the Taliban leadership continues to be as ambiguous in its statements on opium cultivation as it has been hitherto , the Commission refuses to support any anti-drugs projects in Afghanistan .
that said , it will give staunch support to the neighbouring countries , so as to improve their chances of tackling the drugs problem .
thank you , Commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 6.00 p.m .
human rights
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0794 / 2000 , by Mr Medina Ortega , Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas ;
B5-0795 / 2000 , by Mr Di Piandro , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the kidnap of Father Alejandroi Matos Castro in Colombia ;
B5-0796 / 2000 , by Mr Marset Campos , Mr Miranda and Mr Di Lello Finuoli , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on kidnaps , abductions , and the peace process in Colombia ;
B5-0797 / 2000 , by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas .
Mr President , I am speaking to confirm the agreement of the various political groups that have tabled a motion for a resolution on the kidnapping of a Spanish Jesuit in Colombia and to inform the House that we have decided to withdraw it in view of the fact that the person has been freed .
two other Community citizens have also been freed today .
therefore , I am not going to discuss the draft resolution , as it no longer exists .
nevertheless , Colombia is clearly a country that deserves our attention .
but as Mr Linkohr was saying , the problem with Latin America is that we only concern ourselves with these countries when there are problems .
I think this is a good time to highlight the need for the European Union to draw up a comprehensive policy on Latin America which could perhaps prevent these countries from regularly going through the crisis situations that some of them have experienced .
Mr President , I would like to reaffirm what my colleague , Manuel Medina , has just said .
fortunately , in this particular case , we can welcome the fact that the Spanish Jesuit and other Spaniards , as well as other Community citizens , have been released .
it is also true , however , that Colombia , which we frequently discuss here , has several problems .
at the moment , for example , there is a Colombian priest , Oliveiro Medina , who is in Brazil .
his extradition to Colombia could put his life in danger because we have already seen , in the last resolution on Colombia that we discussed , that more than 24 human rights defenders have recently been murdered there .
unfortunately , we all hoped that we would not have to discuss Colombia again .
unfortunately , we may have to discuss it again , but I think that the European Union should have a fundamental role - as Manolo Medina was saying - in Latin America in general .
and reducing budgets for Latin America is not going to help us to play the role that we should be playing there .
Mr President , I would like to share in the happiness of my compatriots and fellow Members who have talked of their satisfaction at the freeing of the Spanish Jesuit Alejandro Matos and of other Community citizens .
I therefore think that we should reiterate our support for a peaceful solution to the Colombian conflict , in which the actions of the drug cartels have a dramatic influence .
the European Union must therefore support the initiatives by President Andrés Pastrana , aimed at achieving a negotiated peace between his government and the guerrilla groups , the FAR ( Revolutionary Armed Forces ) and the so-called National liberation Army .
Mr President , the issue of Colombia is something that really has not been properly addressed in the European Union .
even the Red Cross is leaving there because neither the paramilitaries nor guerrillas respect international humanitarian law .
this highlights that the wrong approach has been taken in relation to Colombia .
signing peace agreements is all very well , but first and foremost we have to have respect for humanitarian law .
that is not happening there .
not so very long ago there was a resolution on the situation of the peace community in San José de Apartado .
that was less than a month ago .
since then the situation has got even worse for the community there .
at the very least five people have been killed .
we have to address the role that the paramilitaries are playing and also the role that the state is playing in this .
it really is not acceptable that people are being persecuted out of their homes , out of their land and that the world is standing idly by and letting this happen .
the state involvement has to be addressed as well .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission , in common with Parliament , welcomes the release of the Spanish Jesuit priest , Alejandro Matos Castro , last week .
we call upon the guerilla groups to release the other hostages .
we urge them to eschew kidnappings in future and to respect international humanitarian law .
the Commission is deeply concerned about the escalation of violence in Colombia , particularly in respect of the massacres perpetrated recently by paramilitary forces in the so-called peaceful communities of San José de Apartado .
we urge the Colombian government again to investigate the precise circumstances of these crimes .
the Commission deplores the ongoing human-rights violations in Colombia and entreats the warring parties to continue the peace talks and work towards a lasting peace in Colombia , based on a negotiated solution .
in this context , I would emphasise that the Commission supports President Pastrana &apos; s efforts to secure peace and will do everything in its power to promote lasting peace in Colombia .
in particular , the Commission would like to have some say in the process when the European Union puts together an aid package in support of the Colombian peace process .
the Commission has already offered to coordinate the measures for a package of this kind , and is planning to approve a considerable amount of funding for this package as early as in the next few days .
furthermore , the Commission has proposed organising in Brussels a follow-up meeting to the Donors Conference that took place on 7 July in Madrid .
thank you , Commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 6.00 p.m .
as several speakers have indicated , I can inform you that after good news from Colombia about the release of the Jesuit priest , and following agreement between the political groups , the motions for resolutions on this issue are withdrawn .
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0779 / 2000 , by Mr Dupuis and others , on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members , on Macedonia ;
B5-0782 / 2000 , by Mr Haarbyr , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on Macedonia : law on higher education and universities ;
B5-0786 / 2000 , by Mrs Pack and others , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on FYROM : law on higher education and universities ;
B5-0788 / 2000 , by Mr Lagendijk and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , law on higher education and universities in Macedonia .
Mr President , I just want to point out that FYROM is rather an anachronism and I invite our Greek colleagues , who always do their duty when Macedonia is on the agenda , to intervene perhaps a little more firmly with their government and supersede this situation , which frankly borders on the ridiculous .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think this resolution is important because it refers to a positive decision by the Macedonian government , and unfortunately not by all the political forces of Macedonia , on the law on higher education which will at last allow young people from minorities , in particular the Albanian minority , to study in their mother tongue .
I think we should congratulate Mr Georgievsky , the Prime Minister , and Mr Xhaferi , leader of the Albanian party in the government majority , who are behind this law on higher education . unfortunately , it was not supported by the parliamentary opposition .
so , once again , we have double standards and I think that is deplorable .
I call on the Commission to monitor this issue very closely .
it will take a great deal of money to establish the university .
this is a practical way of supporting a project which could help overcome the problems of two large , differing populations living side by side , and this is an area where monitoring by the Commission is crucial .
Mr President , I would like to take up what Mr Dupuis had to say .
I believe that when the audience in the stands sees ARYM up there , they will actually think this refers to a different country .
ARYM means Ancienne République Yougoslave de Macédoine , i.e the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
quite simply , that means &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
the dispute about the name is a dispute between Greece and the country of Macedonia .
of course we all hope - and that includes the Greek MEPs here - that this dispute will soon be settled .
we have seen how the difficult situation in Macedonia has steadily worsened where the treatment of the Albanians is concerned .
all of those who , for a long time now , have been going in and out of this country , have kept up the pressure for this problem to be resolved .
however , I would also stress that this problem is nothing new : it is the legacy of the Yugoslav period , when the Albanians were always discriminated against , including those in Macedonia .
unfortunately , it was , of course , the case that the problem was not resolved under the last government , in the run-up to 1998 .
therefore , we are all delighted that a genuinely sound solution is perhaps at last to be found to this problem of higher education .
the illegal foundation of Tetovo university many years ago produced great tension in Macedonia , which I am sorry to say , could not be defused over the past few years .
we owe a duty of care to the students to ensure that this problem is resolved . after all , these students had , or have , diplomas that serve no purpose in the outside world .
therefore , I believe we owe it to the young people to find a solution to the problem , and have now paved the way to this end .
as a delegation , we have always insisted that a solution should be found to this problem .
now at last we have found it .
not us , but the government under Prime Minister Georgievski , and also the Albanian leader , Xhaferi , and above all , the representative of the Council of Europe , Max van der Stoel .
this outstanding cooperation has led to a draft bill , which was adopted by the majority in Parliament .
in common with Olivier Dupuis , I bitterly regret the fact that the opposition parties - which formed part of the government up until 1998 and could have resolved the problem - have closed their minds to this draft bill without offering a better solution themselves .
I am particularly at a loss to understand the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party , which has deliberately closed its mind to the necessary solution to the Albanian problem in Macedonia .
the fact that the Socialist opposition refused to support this must have been against their better judgement , but that sometimes happens with the opposition , and not just in Macedonia .
we are now awaiting the necessary aid for the transformation of Tetovo university into a private university whose diplomas will then be recognised .
all those who want to see an improvement in the inter-ethnic relations in Macedonia , in the interests of stabilisation , must now do their bit to help solve this problem and ensure that a private university actually becomes a reality .
that is what this urgent procedure is all about today .
people from different ethnic backgrounds must be able to live together in Macedonia .
this could provide a good role model for the neighbouring countries and help to stabilise the entire region .
Mr President , it makes a nice change in this Parliament to be able to reflect on positive developments in south-eastern Europe , and very often the subject is Macedonia where , despite all the problems this country has to deal with , the two largest groups of the population co-exist in peace , even form a coalition government and have now adopted a new act on higher education .
that is a breakthrough on an issue which has caused a great deal of problems for a long time .
at long last , the Albanians now have the opportunity to attend university courses in their own language and within the official education system of Macedonia .
that is a real step forward for Macedonia .
as far as I am concerned , it proves to all neighbouring countries that education does not only have to spread hatred , as is often the case these days , but that it can also serve as a cradle for a peaceful , multi-ethnic society .
that is a development which , in my view , deserves unqualified support from the European Union .
finally , I would like to spend a moment on something which , normally speaking , I do not think belongs in a European Parliament , namely the role of a fellow countryman .
I am proud of the fact , that this time round , the role of Mr Max van der Stoel , the High Representative for minorities of the OSCE , has proved crucial in this issue .
Mr President , I would like to echo Mr Lagendijk &apos; s praise of Mr Van der Stoel .
I believe it is extremely important for the outside world to send positive vibes to Macedonia .
that does not mean to say that the Macedonian people are not sufficiently alert themselves to be able to deliver something in this area .
the former President , Mr Gligorov , was already a shining example of non-ethnic thinking , and the new President , too , has gained the trust of all groups of the population in Macedonia .
in my view , it is an extraordinary achievement on the part of the Macedonians to be able to settle the issue within their own borders .
it appears to me that cooperation between Slavonic Macedonians and especially Albanian-speaking Macedonians is an extremely important topic which could manifest itself in the fight over the important initiative to establish a university in Tetovo .
this initiative has been on the cards for years and still there is no talk of official recognition .
fortunately , this initiative is now being backed by a parliamentary majority , as a result of which a key problem in the inter-ethnic relations has been solved , not only because it is so important to teach in Albanian at the universities , but especially because it considerably enhances the social position of the Albanian-speaking Macedonians .
it attracts a new class of students to higher education .
it is also significant in terms of the presence of Albanian speakers in the official apparatus , a presence which is currently lagging far behind what should actually be the case .
it appears to me that the recognition of degrees from Tetovo university is a major step forward .
in time , the university should also be funded by taxpayers &apos; money only . after all , the Albanian speakers pay taxes and are just as entitled to a share when it comes to paying for education .
I , myself , was educated at a university which was a &apos; Free University &apos; , free from church and state influence , yet government-funded .
I have to say that I still believe this to be a great bonus and it also proves that the state respects the country &apos; s own particular educational sphere .
the outside world should do all it can to help the Albanian speakers integrate in their country .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my group proposes to support the present motion , which we have also signed , because I believe it is right for the European Union to support the solution that has been found in Macedonia and which accommodates the Albanian population .
I would have preferred it if we could have found a solution that all the parties in Parliament could have voted for .
we would rather leave it to the Macedonians to discuss where the process broke down , Mrs Pack .
I have it on good authority that they were only trivial issues , and that the government could have accommodated the opposition in this respect .
I do not know .
I do not think that is the be-all and end-all .
what matters most is that a solution is found which we can all subscribe to .
that is an important aspect we should not lose sight of .
Mr President , General De Gaulle spoke of the &quot; paix des braves &quot; i.e. the peace of the brave , in the era of Franco-German reconciliation , by which he meant that patriots on both sides had been able to achieve a lasting settlement .
that is exactly what has happened in Macedonia .
therefore , I also believe that this reconciliation is sustainable , but that the government , which has very courageously found a solution to the university issue and to many other issues , needs visible signs of its success , and powerful support , else peace throughout the region will be under threat .
that is why it is so important , firstly , to find a solution to the name problem .
when Greece , of all countries , again puts forward a proposal to call it Slavo-Macedonia , it really is asking for trouble , because that is precisely what the Albanians would regard as being another example of exclusion tactics .
I am sure this would defuse no small number of problems in Macedonia , too .
I feel Macedonia has every chance of becoming a type of Switzerland of the South-East , and we should give it massive support on this journey , and reject anything that could lead to a relapse into nationalism and chauvinism , which , I am sorry to say , certain forces in the country are currently trying to provoke for tactical reasons .
without doubt , the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is helping enormously to promote peace and security in the region and we trust that the last problem in its relations with Greece will shortly be resolved in a way which respects the dignity of both countries .
I welcome with the utmost satisfaction the new law on higher education , which will create the conditions needed for the Albanian-speaking community to set up a private university .
I am convinced that this tiny country in the Balkans deserves the undivided support of the European Union and I trust that an association and stability agreement will be signed before the end of the French Presidency .
that is why the Commission has repeatedly urged the Macedonian Government to resolve the outstanding problem of higher education in the Albanian language .
the Commission welcomes the passing of the new law .
the Commission is working with the OSCE High Commissioner for national minorities , Max van der Stoel , with a view to providing financial support for the implementation of this important law .
perhaps I could use this opportunity to say that the cooperation between the Commission and the High Commissioner , Mr van der Stoel , has already got off to a good start .
our combined efforts have enabled us to solve a similar problem that existed in two other European countries , i.e. Estonia and Latvia , and I am grateful to be able to take this opportunity to say that our cooperation with the OSCE High Commissioner in this respect has been extremely constructive and valuable .
I believe the same will apply to Macedonia .
the Commission is intending to make EUR 1 million available for the current year , under the national programme for Macedonia , in order to support the implementation of this law .
the funding allocation is provided for in the financing proposal which is to be put forward today - possibly this very hour - to the PHARE administration committee .
if the Member States adopt this financing proposal , a financing agreement will be concluded with the government and a detailed project will be drawn up in close cooperation with Mr van der Stoel in the coming weeks .
the PHARE funding made available for the year 2000 under the national programme could also be used to support the university in the coming academic year , i.e. in 2001 and 2002 .
thank you , Commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 6.00 p.m .
Samina ferry disaster in Greece
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0783 / 2000 , by Mr Katiforis and others , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the sinking of the Greek ferry ;
B5-0787 / 2000 , by Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Trakatellis , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on the sinking of the vessel &apos; Express Samina &apos; ;
B5-0791 / 2000 , by Mr Korakas and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on the sinking of the vessel &apos; Express Samina &apos; .
we are not debating here merely in order to express our sorrow ; the main subject of our debate is what happened , why it happened and how we can rectify the situation , how the Commission and the European Parliament can help from now on to ensure that the same does not happen again in the future .
there can be no doubt that the human factor played a decisive part .
however , there are aspects of the accident which , in my view , prove that Community law has been infringed .
the directive on the registration of passengers was infringed .
the Minister has admitted as much , the Prime Minister admitted as much yesterday in Parliament and I hope that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will admit as much .
the directive on life-saving equipment , life-jackets and life-rafts was infringed .
Mr President , on Sunday , three hours before the deadline for applying Directive 98 / 18 expired , some 50 Greek ships were taken out of service by the Ministry of merchant Marine .
what amazes me is that the Government and the company both insist that the Express Samina complied with all the safety requirements .
in other words , had it not sunk , it would still be sailing .
the government itself says so .
so what are we calling for ? we are calling mainly for three things .
firstly , full application of Directive 98 / 41 on the registration of passengers . secondly , a shorter timetable for Directive 98 / 18 so that there are no longer any derogations for Member States , as has been the case to date with Greece .
Parliament consented at second reading under pressure from the Greek government at the time .
Mr Stenmark remembers and can testify to this . and , of course , we are calling for an end to the derogation for Greece on cabotage , the monopoly and oligopoly arrangements governing transport by sea .
Greek cabotage operators are running their new ships on the routes to Italy , where there is competition , and their old ships on the Greek routes , where there is no competition , and that is how safety standards drop .
I should like to point out that all the Greek MEPs have now reacted against this situation .
we do not consider that everything is a mess in Greece ; there are some very good ships and the overwhelming majority of Greek seamen are very good at their job .
we have tabled the motion as an expression of our awareness of the issue and our intention to fight for Greece to adopt even higher safety standards than the European Union in order to correct this negative impression of our country .
three amendments have been proposed by the GUE / NGL Group , one on shipping registers , one on working conditions and one on an in situ investigation by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
we disagree mainly on technical grounds , which I do not have time to go into now , but would be happy to explain privately to my fellow Members .
the problems are technical rather than political : for example , as far as shipping registers are concerned , the resolution already contains a reference to them and there is no need to repeat it .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we voted against a resolution on the sinking of the Express Samina under the urgent procedure the other day because a judicial inquiry is already under way in Greece and the Greek Government had already made a number of statements on what needs to be done .
we feel that the word of the European Parliament needs weight if it is to be more than passing comment .
besides , our Parliament does the same every time a sad incident such as this happens . must it continue to do so ?
someone said in the House the other day that we do not want to debate shipping safety .
but has there ever been or will there ever be an in-depth debate in 2 or 3 minutes under the urgent procedure ?
in deference to the House &apos; s decision the other day , we sat round the table and thrashed out a joint text which , I admit , was only made possible by the cooperation and good faith of all the groups .
but , surely , this is precisely what our proactive Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism is doing and - as we all know - it needs serious and often time-consuming dialogue and procedures in order to decide what needs to be done on each occasion .
is it that easy to decide what needs to be done about shipping under an urgent procedure ?
nor was the need for urgent procedure justified after the event , given that the compromise text contains no references which might have been misunderstood as urgent party politics against the Greek Government , precisely as the result of the good faith which , as I have said , was demonstrated on all sides .
so the question remains . what have we gained from the text which would have been lost had the resolution not been urgent ?
be that as it may , Mr President , we have agreed to this joint proposal for a resolution , which we support as it stands , urgently , and we of course disagree with the amendments tabled , again urgently , for the reasons which I have stated .
and as far as shipping is concerned , in deference to the memory of the innocent victims of the Express Samina , we shall support and take the lead in any action which targets personal safety and environmental protection and tries to do more than just make an impression .
I do not know if it will be under the urgent procedure but , in essence , it must be as quickly as possible . and they do not only concern Greece .
of course , we also need to reorganise and refine administrative monitoring , control and sanctioning procedures .
Mr Papoutsis has already &quot; dismantled &quot; a very important directorate in his ministry , the Directorate of merchant ship surveys .
it is only a very small first step , I know , and other steps are needed .
and because all this concerns Greece , which has the biggest shipping sector in the European Union , it basically concerns the safety of all types of shipping throughout the Union .
Mr President , I too shall , of course , start by expressing my deepest sorrow and solidarity with the families of the victims and with those who survived along with the memory of their terrifying ordeal .
of course , accidents at sea happen , human errors are made ; but what is most important , Mr President , is for us to see , when a human error is made , if the right action was taken before and after the error .
in other words , in the present case , if the right inspections were carried out and the right certificates issued for the ship , if the life-jackets were in the right places , if the crew was doing its job .
there is a whole series of things which need looking at right away , especially if Community legislation was also infringed .
in my view , the Greek competition committee has never acted in cases in which it should have acted .
and , as we know , monopolies , be they private or state monopolies , are a bad thing . in the present case they are bad for both freight and passenger shipping .
it seems to me that the factor which needs to be quantified here as the result of this tragic incident , is what needs to be done at European Union level , because the bigger picture is the safety of shipping in the European Union .
I should like to say , as far as the resolution is concerned , because there are a number of amendments , that my amendment on shipping registers is covered in the text , it is already there .
as far as my amendment on working conditions is concerned , there is a directive on this and the wording of the amendment is less satisfactory than the text .
that is what we are waiting to hear from the European Commission .
Mr President , I too would like to express my deepest condolences to the family of those killed tragically in this ferry disaster , but also pay tribute to those involved in the rescue effort , not least of course , the Royal Navy .
on behalf of the Socialist transport team , I regret the fact that this debate is taking place as an urgency .
it could be more properly debated in committee next week , but that was the decision of the House which , of course , I respect .
what we certainly do not need today , or indeed next week , or in the future , is a point-scoring exercise between our Greek colleagues in the run-up to the general election in Greece .
that serves no one &apos;s interest .
this is not a concern solely for Greece .
it is a matter for Europe as a whole .
this was an accident waiting to happen .
some of us have worked on the issue of ferry safety for many years , not least because other ferries in other parts of Europe have also sunk with a tragic loss of life , be it the Herald of Free Enterprise , the Scandinavian STAR or , of course , most notoriously of all , the Estonia in the 1990s .
all these demonstrate that ferries are not safe enough .
in our view , this tragedy could well happen again .
not because we have too few laws in Europe , but because the laws are not properly enforced .
it is not just Greece .
there are other Member States that do not comply with maritime safety laws and if I may , I will name some : Italy , Belgium , Denmark , Ireland and the Presidency , France , are all failing to implement the port-state control directive .
I hope today , and in the coming days and weeks , we will hear from the Commission on what action they propose to take against these Member States that do not take maritime safety seriously .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to join the name of my own group in expressing sympathy and solidarity with the families of the deceased and the survivors of the shipwreck and gratitude also to those involved in the rescue operations .
it is human nature to be the more affected by a tragedy the closer it comes to one .
if I speak with special feeling in this debate , it is because over the years Greece has become another home to me .
I have had many opportunities during this time to observe just how skilful Greek seamanship can be .
but the issue cannot be localised in this way .
in recent years many other lives have been lost at sea in our waters , not only by way of major ferry disasters but , on all too frequent a basis , from amongst our fishing communities .
that is why we have to address issues of maritime safety more generally and in the constructive way suggested in this motion .
I , too , would put particular stress on the need to implement properly the legislation we already have .
I would ask that we become even more cautious than we ever have been before about allowing derogations from future legislation where matters of safety are concerned .
nor are such issues important only for those of us who come from areas where the sea is our highway or our place of work .
they are important for us all , even when we are not immediately affected .
this is so , if only because , in the words of the early English poet , John Donne , any man &apos;s death diminishes me because I am part of mankind .
Mr President , on behalf of my group , I , too , should like to add our condolences to the families who have lost loved ones in this tragedy .
our thoughts are very much with them at this particular time .
as a Member who represents Scotland , I feel a particular sadness and concern too about these events .
although Scotland and Greece sit at the furthest edges of the European Union , we nevertheless share a common topography .
both our countries have many island communities around our shores and as such the people of Scotland &apos;s islands felt a particular sense of shock following the recent events in Greece .
our island communities depend on ferry services as an absolute lifeline .
these ships provide transport for passengers and goods and ensure the sustainability of some of Europe &apos;s most remote and fragile communities .
it is the duty of Member States to make sure that the owners and operators of ferries are aware of their responsibilities for the safe passage of people and goods .
we are fortunate in Scotland not to have directly suffered the type of tragedy to hit Greece but we are only too well aware that our waters are some of the most hazardous in Europe .
we have many concerns about the forthcoming tendering process which is under way .
I should like to ask the Commission for some assurance that in tendering for lifeline ferry services , or indeed any ferry services , safety is given its highest priority .
in the cut-throat world of tendering , all too often companies can be pushed into cost-cutting measures and I would not like to see safety measures being sacrificed .
it is simply not acceptable to the northern and western Isles of Scotland , nor for the potential North Sea to European mainland crossing which I hope will be established in the not-too-distant future .
our citizens deserve the best of safeguards in sea transport .
the trade unions who represent the men and women who work on ferries , as well as representatives of our seaboard communities , ought to be involved in discussions at the pre-tender stage , so that they can play a role in ensuring that safe practice is not sacrificed for the sake of profit .
Mr President , allow me start by expressing by deepest sorrow and sympathy for the victims of this tragic sinking .
it has been argued , including here in the House that the human factor was to blame .
this argument is the least unacceptable .
the legal framework for shipping in Greece and in the European Union in general has proven to be inadequate and dangerous and we need new , stricter rules , especially for very old ships , rules without derogations .
equally dangerous is the modus operandi of the regulatory authorities and the shipping register which , by operating as a private , profit-making company , is basically controlled by the very shipowners it is supposed to be controlling .
even the tragic shipwreck has not thrown up any useful conclusions .
on the contrary , innocent victims are being exploited in order to promote shipowners &apos; wider objectives .
Hurrying to suspend cabotage in Greek seas , as earnestly called for , including in this joint resolution , will intensify profit-seeking competition between the shipping companies , with even more tragic consequences for passengers .
Mr President , my group would also like to express its condolences to those involved in the Samina Express disaster .
such a disaster is always a sad event , especially if it could have been prevented .
let us therefore hope that the inquiry into the cause can give us a clear picture of the situation , at which stage it will be possible to take adequate measures .
judging from the survivors and those involved , we can already draw two conclusions .
disasters at sea are often caused by a lack of maintenance and a lack of staff who are both able and aware of their responsibilities .
it is particularly tragic since this tragedy can also be put down to the lifting of EU legislation .
I am pleased that the Greek government has now nullified this exemption .
the European Union should be very wary when granting exemptions to EU legislation , particularly when public safety is at stake .
I would , in this light , refer to two other southern countries that would like to join the European Union in due course .
the quality of both ships and staff under their flags is rather more notorious than renowned .
we cannot afford to make the same mistake again .
on a final note , I would just like to say that great human suffering forces us to draw lessons from this tragedy .
it is unfortunate that we still have to learn the hard way .
this resolution points us in the right direction .
Mr President , as you are aware , Bavaria , more than any other German Land , has an extraordinary affinity with Greece .
this had its effect in the 19th century , during the wars of liberation .
the first Greek king was a Bavarian , and it also has its effect in the present day , in that a particularly large number of people from Bavaria go on holiday to this beautiful country .
there are particularly large numbers of Bavarian tourists in Greece .
therefore it came as a double shock to us to have to see these terrible pictures and hear this dreadful news .
it was a shock because families suffered so badly as a result , and because we mourn the loss of human life , but it was also a shock because it revealed a flagrant disregard for safety .
we must be aware that when something like this happens , the credibility of the European Union also comes into play .
time and again , we rightly complain that there is too much of a centralising drive in various areas .
we criticise any attempts to formulate a common European tourism policy , which some people here want .
that is something we can confidently leave to the Member States and regions .
according to the principle of subsidiarity , tourism policy is something that should be devolved to Member State level .
but what people in all countries must be able to depend on in equal measure , are safety standards .
that is precisely why it is one of the European Union &apos; s most important tasks to ensure that exceptions are no longer made where safety standards are concerned , as has obviously been the case here .
we must be in no doubt that , particularly in an era of cross-border mass tourism , whether it be tunnels - where there was a spate of disasters last summer - or ships , which have been involved in a great many disasters in recent years , people expect to be able to depend on safety standards within the European Union .
human error happens all over the world .
Greek sailors are excellent and famous for being of a high standard .
but what we must realise is that when it comes to technical standards , there is , I am sorry to say , a degree of chaos in this region .
this is the point at which the European Union and the European Parliament must take direct responsibility .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission shares the deep sorrow and consternation felt throughout Greece over this horrendous accident .
the Commission has expressed its sympathy to the families of the victims and the Greek government .
unfortunately , this is not the first accident of its kind in European waters and , as I am sure you know , the European Union took decisive measures after the last serious ferry accident , the Estonia disaster in 1994 .
a series of far-reaching provisions was introduced in order to improve the safety of ferry passengers .
as you will recall , the purpose of the provisions introduced at that time was to ensure : first , that passengers are registered .
secondly , that harmonised safety standards are applied , including in relation to stability and rescue equipment for inland traffic in the European Union .
thirdly , that compulsory surveys and investigations are carried out after accidents .
fourthly , that social standards are maintained on board and , fifthly , that the shipping safety code is applied to ferry operator companies .
as a result , domestic and foreign voyages by passenger ferries to or from Union ports are covered by a complete legal framework .
it is the Commission &apos; s job to monitor the practical application of this legal framework within its remit as set out in the Treaty .
the Commission therefore contacted the Greek authorities as soon as the Express Samina went down , requesting clarification of the application of Community law .
the Commission asked the Greek authorities to check if the ships required to adopt the Community &apos; s safety standards by 30 September had in fact done so .
as a result of the check requested by the Commission , 60 ships were taken out of service pending proof of compliance with standards .
the Commission fully endorses the European Parliament &apos; s view that safety regulations applicable to passenger ferries now need to be tightened .
the Member of the Commission responsible , Vice-President De Palacio , therefore intends to include the question of revising the current directive on safety standards for passenger ferries in its work programme for 2001 .
the Commission also intends to conduct a detailed examination of passenger transport liability regulations , in order to ascertain if they need to be changed .
finally , I should like to stress that the Commission is convinced of the need to make European legislation on the safety of passenger ferries a top priority and to ensure that this legislation is applied strictly and uniformly throughout the Community .
only thus will we contain the risk of a repeat of such accidents .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 6.00 p.m .
honourable Members , we have finished the last debate and there is a short time left before the start of the debate and statement by Mr Solana , the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy on both the situation in the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia .
we shall therefore take a short break .
Mr President , as you just said , the debate with Mr. Solana is not due to start for another 25 minutes , despite the fact that there are a great many urgent questions which cannot now be dealt with .
we have finished early nearly every Thursday afternoon over recent weeks .
there is nothing on the agenda this evening after the vote on the Plumb report and tomorrow morning &apos; s agenda is almost non-existent .
it seems to me that a curious discrepancy is starting to take shape .
on Tuesday and Wednesday , there were considerable delays .
question time with the Commission started nearly one and a half hours late and yet Thursday &apos; s agenda is disappearing before our very eyes .
the question which I wish to raise and which I would ask the Bureau to clarify is if , having done away with Fridays , certain parties are now trying to do away with Thursdays .
we all know that you strongly advocate Friday sittings and you are perfectly within your rights to do so .
I think your point deserves discussion .
we have taken note of it and I personally shall ensure that this aspect is discussed in detail at the next Bureau meeting .
the sitting was suspended at 4.36 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m .
situation in the Middle East - elections in Yugoslavia
the next item is the statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy on the situation in the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia .
we are delighted to welcome Mr Solana , and I shall waste no time in inviting him to speak .
thank you , Mr Solana .
like Mr Solana , Commissioner Verheugen will be speaking on the two issues on our agenda this afternoon , which is to say the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia .
afterwards the Members of Parliament who have put their names down will speak .
I think the groups have arranged that they will speak on the first issue initially , and then on the second .
Madam President , High Representative , honourable Members . I agree with the High Representative &apos; s observations on the situation in the Middle East and on the situation in Belgrade .
allow me to start by saying a few words on Serbia .
during the elections on 24 September , the Serbian people ousted Milosevic and his regime .
the Serbian people voted clearly in favour of a new beginning with new political leaders .
the European Union has always made it clear that the Serbian people have as much right to be in Europe as any of the other people of Europe .
we have always made it clear that we would radically revise our policy towards Serbia if the Serbian people voted at the elections in favour of the opposition and , hence , democratic change .
we made it clear - and I should like to reaffirm this - that any decision in favour of democratic change would also be a decision to return to Europe .
there is not the shadow of a doubt that this message was heard in Serbia and the Serbian people have cast their vote .
the victory has been won , although the regime has made and continues to make huge efforts to forestall it .
the question of whether democratic change can now be introduced and if it can be introduced without violence will perhaps be decided in the next few hours on the streets of Belgrade .
allow me to say loud and clear : Europe unreservedly supports the democratic opposition in Serbia .
we call for the voice of the Serbian people to be heard and respected and we share its burning desire to see the back of Milosevic and his cohorts , who have brought so much suffering and unhappiness to so many , both in Serbia and in several other countries .
as soon as the will of the people is respected - and it will be , of that I have no doubt - what has happened in Serbia will create an opportunity for real , lasting peace in the Balkans .
it will give the Serbian people the chance to rejoin the European family of nations and to build a peaceful and stable future together with its neighbours .
if the Serbian people bring about democratic change - and the European Union promised this a long time ago - the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will enjoy the same benefits as its neighbours and the European Union will maintain the same relations with it .
we must be prepared to keep this promise as soon as the will of the people is respected .
as Mr Solana has already indicated - and I can confirm that the Commission is already working on reconstruction aid for the Serbian economy and infrastructure - this aid will come to fruition as soon as a democratic government is in office .
we are prepared to lift sanctions and provide emergency aid against the harsh winter conditions .
the President of the Commission commented last week that this is an immense task which we must tackle immediately and without delay , as soon as the will of the people is respected .
I think that the signal which this debate sends to Belgrade today will be decisive .
the message which Parliament must send can only be to urge Milosevic one more time , perhaps for the last time , to see the writing on the wall , step down and pave the way for democratic change in Serbia .

I should like to make a few comments on the dramatic and rapid developments in the Middle East .
we feel deep sorrow and sympathy for the numerous victims .
it is mainly Palestinians who have fallen victim to the conflicts which have re-ignited over the last few days .
we cannot be harsh enough in condemning the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force .
we condemn any action which deserves to be seen as provocation , especially in connection with the holy sites in Jerusalem .
we welcome and support the efforts being made by President Chirac , President Mubarak and Secretary of State Albright and can only hope that the supreme objective of ending the violence and restoring peace and order will be achieved .
on the question of the committee of enquiry , the Commission supports the Presidency &apos; s stance .
obviously , this crisis may have dangerous repercussions on the peace process .
we share this concern .
nonetheless - and I take the same view here as Mr Solana - it would be premature to consider that agreement between Israel and Palestine is now out of the question .
the window of opportunity will be open until the end of October .
after that , the stability of Prime Minister Barak &apos; s government will be in jeopardy and there will be tremendous pressure on President Arafat to declare statehood .
I hope that the meeting between President Mubarak , President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak in Sharm el Sheik will mark a return to constructive negotiation on a lasting peace agreement .
it is our job to convince Israel that recognising and respecting the rights of the Palestinians , with all the compromises which that implies , is the best way of safeguarding its long-term national interests .
Israel &apos; s long-term interests lie in lasting peace .
we must convince the Palestinians that the best way of achieving their objectives and safeguarding their rights is to negotiate with Israel .
I should like to reaffirm that the European Union supports the peace process because it is the only mechanism which can make the only possible alternative for Israel and the Palestinian people come true .
fair , comprehensive peace , even if it means painful compromises on both sides .
however complicated the issues may be , the parties must grab the historic chance which they now have .
anything else would be an awful tragedy .
negotiations should build on the progress made in Camp David in July .
this progress was not directly tangible , to be sure , because the summit as a whole was not successful .
but nor was Camp David a failure , because the gulf between the parties was clearly narrowed and some serious taboos were overcome .
the European Union &apos; s stand on the substance of the peace process has not changed .
we support the parties in negotiating an agreement in keeping with the principles and references of the peace process set in motion in Madrid .
we are convinced that a compromise can be found on all the points at issue .
we are also prepared to make a contribution and provide help .
if , as we hope , the parties manage to conclude an agreement , the European Union will add its political and financial support to the efforts being made by others on the basis of a fair distribution of the burden and will meet the parties &apos; demands to a reasonable extent .
we are prepared to work on securing stability in the region and , in the long term , on safeguarding the permanent welfare of the region through sustainable economic growth and an improved standard of living , so that the people in the region can reap the benefits of peace .
this philosophy is in complete accord with a stronger Barcelona Europe-Mediterranean process and we shall continue our efforts within the context of that process .
thank you , Commissioner Verheugen .
I know from experience that it is a lot more difficult for an army to win peace than a war .
I know that the transition from fighting to peacekeeping requires troops who are capable , not of unleashing violence from their weapons in the conquest of an objective , but of controlling that violence .
that requires special training , standard now for soldiers in European Union armies , because we are lucky enough to be at peace .
the forces of Israel and Palestine are not so lucky .
it is up to us to take our place beside the United Nations and the United States of America and , in close cooperation with them , to continue tirelessly supporting all those who have the determination to succeed at the price of the necessary concessions .
and I have one question , Mr Solana : surely the time has come for an intelligent and courageous initiative by the European Union on the status of Jerusalem ?
we all know that is the crux of the matter and we have not forgotten the interesting proposals we have heard on this subject in this very Chamber , which deserve our support .
Madam President , I want to begin by expressing my deep sympathy with those families who have been affected by the latest bloody events that have taken place in the area we are talking about .
like others , I also want to express my concern about what is happening and , at the same time , say that , whenever this area is talked about , the impression given is really one of crossing a minefield and of its not taking very much to provoke a reaction , almost no matter what is said .
I too , however , must urge both the Commissioner and Mr Solana to do everything in their powers to press for the successful achievement of a ceasefire agreement , so that the bloody events in question might be brought to an end .
if that does not happen , a chain reaction might be triggered , in other countries too , which might prove to be uncontrollable .
a minor example of this is the events that took place yesterday in Copenhagen when a peaceful demonstration turned violent . happily , no-one was killed as a result , but unfortunately a number of people were injured .
what we in the EU must and shall do , therefore , is continue talking in terms of negotiation , negotiation and , again , negotiation , so that those windows which are now open do not close before we have achieved a result .
a peace agreement is needed now . otherwise , there is a strong possibility of things ending in disaster .
Madam President , my contribution today is not based on all kinds of theoretical analyses but on my own experiences over the past week , because I happened to be in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip when the disturbances took place .
on that basis , I would like to make three observations .
firstly , I would like to comment on Mr Sharon &apos; s provocation on Thursday .
it was clear from the outset that the issue was one of internal party-politics , namely the battle between Sharon and Netanyahu .
in my view , what is far more damaging is the fact that this provocation was condoned by Prime Minister Barak , who , in my view , either made the huge mistake of wrongly gauging the implications of Mr Sharon &apos; s visit , or made a conscious attempt to bring the whole situation to a head .
secondly , I would like to turn to the disturbances at the al Aqsa Mosque on Friday .
the next day , I talked to various people who visited that Mosque and it is really incomprehensible that various men in their fifties and sixties - i.e. not those throwing the stones - were shot at in the Mosque .
talking of provocation , I find it extremely shocking that the Israeli Government should shoot people who were praying in the Mosque on temple Mount on the Holy Day of the Muslims , and I believe that the international community was entirely justified in its condemnation of the incident .
my final comment concerns a visit to the hospital in Eastern Jerusalem the next day . in fact , I have quite a few observations regarding that visit .
I found it extremely shocking to see that during the disturbances , an ambulance driver was shot .
in another incident which I witnessed with my own eyes , an ambulance driver was shot in the foot from a ten centimetre range as he was trying to come to the rescue of some people . the most shocking of all is the fact that the Israeli police and the army used fragmentation bullets .
these are bullets which , upon contact with the body , shatter into dozens of pieces . they are banned internationally , even in battles amongst soldiers ; yet they are now used against citizens .
my conclusion is that the Israeli Government has applied excessive force which has been widely condemned , and rightly so .
my question to Mr Solana and the Commission is the following : what could the European Union do in very concrete terms in order , first of all , to substantiate the international inquiry into these disturbances , and secondly , to bring the peace process back on track ?
Madam President , Mohamed was one of the many babies killed by the Israeli army . eight years on from the signing of the peace agreements , the army still occupies over 80 % of the territories .
the settlers have opened fire .
how can we describe these new massacres and this Palestinian rebellion .
more stone-throwing youths ?
it is more than that .
the Palestinian security forces are also firing .
Ariel Sharon was the catalyst but the responsibility also lies with the government which allowed him to visit the holy site and did not stop the soldiers firing on the crowd .
while condemning all forms of violence , we cannot make any parallel between the Israeli violence and the Palestinian violence .
on the one hand , there is a state and an army occupying a territory in breach of all international laws and , on the other , there is a people who is tired of suffering and humiliation .
this is not the work of Hamas : it is the uprising of a people who have had enough of being oppressed and are not being given satisfaction even by their own leaders and decision-makers .
it is the revolt of the Palestinians who live in Israel who are not only demonstrating their solidarity with their brothers but demanding to be treated as citizens with full rights and to be allowed to live free from discrimination in Israel .
we must play our part in bringing the violence to an end and re-establishing negotiations : the fighting must cease , the Israeli soldiers must be withdrawn , there must be an international inquiry , at which Europe must be present , and the Palestinian people must be protected .
it would be enough for the European Union and the UN to make it clear that the UN resolutions , starting with resolutions 338 , 242 and 194 on the return of refugees to their homes , apply .
this would in itself have a major impact and could change Israel &apos;s - by now - firm conviction that it can always do whatever it likes with impunity .
the right of the State of Israel to exist and to security is very important to us , as are the Israelis themselves who , together with the Palestinians , are currently demonstrating that they have had enough of occupation and enough of this violence .
but the rights of the Palestinian State are no less important .
in my opinion , Europe can and must do a great deal in this direction , and it must be clear and resolute .
it is true that peace is achieved through dialogue but rights have to be respected , and here rights are not being respected .
it is not a question of the Israelis making concessions ; we must enforce the law .
Madam President , the bloody confrontations which have taken place in the last few days in Jerusalem , the Gaza Strip , the West Bank and Israel are particularly serious , because of the high numbers of victims and also because they have brought renewed talk of exclusion as regards the State of Israel , talk that we thought belonged to the past and which is dangerously irresponsible .
the violence , the unacceptable provocation , the disproportionate reaction against the Palestinian people must not become a pretext for questioning the fundamental right of both peoples , Israeli and Palestinian , to have a state to ensure expression of their nationhood .
some of the statements that have been made - here , even , and elsewhere - are disturbing .
they are not likely to make negotiations any easier , quite the contrary .
the events of the last few days demonstrate exactly how fragile the peace process is .
so we must do everything possible to douse the fire as quickly as possible .
the only effective way of doing that is through intergovernmental talks and Mr Solana , who has just left us , is right to concentrate his efforts in that direction .
and here I want to pay homage to the resolute diplomacy of the United States , France and Egypt in particular .
the main lesson to be drawn from these grave troubles , the source of which has been Jerusalem , and more specifically the temple Mount and the al Aqsa Mosque compound , is that as long as the negotiations on Jerusalem and in particular on the Holy Places are put off , peace cannot be definitely assured .
it is absolutely essential to end the dangerous deadlock where each side considers it unthinkable that the other should have sovereignty over the Holy Places .
so , negotiations should concentrate on the possibility of making the most sensitive areas neutral , and why not revive the proposal made here on 2 September by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council , Mr Ahmed Qurie ?
I think this avenue ought to be explored as soon as possible , because until the Jerusalem question is resolved , it will continue to be the source of periodic confrontations likely to degenerate in the same way as the tragic events we are currently witnessing .
Madam President , there is no doubt that Europe would be well advised to seize the opportunity presented to us here by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council .
Madam President , I have just been talking to the group Chairman in the front row .
I have not yet had a chance to talk to the others further up , but we are entirely in favour of your making a statement expressing what I believe is the unanimous feeling of this Parliament towards the Serb people .
that is the most direct method and we hope the message can reach those people in their heroic struggle for democracy .
thank you for that proposal , Mr Barón Crespo , and for your confidence in me .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I have one minute to put my position on an issue which has been close to my heart since 1967 . the evidence seems to be that the State of Israel has no intention , and never has had any intention , of negotiating seriously with Palestine and granting it all the powers of a sovereign and independent nation .
the State of Israel sees many advantages in this situation of latent conflict and does not hesitate to make use of them .
whatever the alleged good intentions of certain Israeli leaders , nothing has really changed for the Palestinians .
colonisation of the occupied territories is increasing .
the economic dependence of Palestine is increasing .
access to the Muslim Holy Places is being made more and more difficult .
the Palestinian leaders are in a no-win situation .
the fact is , they either accept perpetual talks , generally under the auspices of the United States , and endorse the expansionist policy of the State of Israel or , with the aid of other Muslim countries and their traditional friends , they create a new and more favourable balance of power .
this new balance of power calls , in particular , for the immediate proclamation of a Palestinian State , the use of oil as a weapon and more organised recourse to legitimate defence .
Madam President , the peace process in the Middle East is extremely fragile .
such a situation requires tact .
Provocations such as those initiated by Mr Ariel Sharon , must be refrained from .
however , violence is not a legitimate response to provocation , and calling on the population to use violence certainly is not .
if the European Union wants to be a reliable partner in the peace process , it will have to unequivocally condemn provocations and calls for violent action .
to this end , my group has tabled two amendments to the resolution to that effect .
it is not acceptable only to condemn Israel if the Palestinian leadership is still using violence as a possible tool in the negotiations .
it is heartrending if children are sacrificed in a battle which should be settled around the negotiating table .
the position of Jerusalem is a moot point in the negotiations .
I call on this Parliament to follow the Biblical line : pray for peace in Jerusalem so that the Jews and Arabs can live together in peace .
Madam President , over the last few days , we have watched the dream of peace in the Middle East disintegrate .
the horrifying pictures of children running for cover being killed and of civilians being fired at from tanks and helicopters give us just a tiny glimpse of the hell which could be in store for both sides , Israel and Palestine , if they fail to conclude and implement the peace process as quickly as possible .
that is the most important aspect at the moment , not apportioning blame and condemnation .
the European Union should do everything it can to serve this objective and the potential inherent in it .
however , I am not prepared - as I have been urged on several occasions , purely in order to appear fair - to refrain from calling the events of the last few days by their proper name or from making the same demands on both sides , as if the provocation and force were divided equally between them .
or should I call on the Hamas leader Scheich Yassin to refrain from his possible intention of visiting the wailing wall on the Sabbath in order to provoke the Jews praying there ?
should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army to withdraw its tanks and helicopters from Israeli towns and villages and stop firing on civilian Israelis ?
should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army not to shoot any small Israeli children cowering behind walls and trying to take cover behind barrels ?
I am not prepared to engage in this sort of fairness .
but I am prepared to call on my fellow members in the House to have the courage to call a murder a murder and to condemn provocation as provocation and not as counter-productivity , as Mrs Albright said , in order to gloss things over , purely to appear fair towards both sides .
in this respect , I am most grateful for the clear statement made by my fellow Member Mr Lagendijk .
Madam President , I think the text of this resolution is a perfect demonstration that Europe will never act as a mediator between Israel and Palestine .
once again , there is confusion between , on the one hand , a democratic State doing its best to deal with an extremely difficult situation and , on the other , the institution at the heart of Palestine which , under provocation certainly , immediately takes up arms to shoot at the Israeli forces of order .
that is happening again today , and that is what will prevent , and has prevented Europe from acting as mediator in the Middle East all these years , leaving the United States to fulfil that role alone .
finally , regarding Serbia , I would like to tell Mr Barón Crespo that he and his group might at least have the good grace to keep quiet on the subject , given that throughout the previous parliament his group was willing to go to any lengths to block any action designed to bring Milosevic to justice , and when a majority was achieved it was not with the support of the Socialist Group .
Madam President , fellow Members . it is of course difficult , as events unfold in Belgrade , to sit here calmly and give a speech which was prepared before all this came to pass .
I expected today &apos; s events to take place last Monday .
we all know that the people have stormed Parliament , that the television station , which has been fully occupied by the army , has been stormed and that army vehicles and the police are now out in force in the middle of Belgrade .
we can only hope that all the people hiding behind the army and behind the police - all of whom are essentially there to serve the people , not a dictator such as Milosevic - will think twice before turning against the peaceful demonstrators .
since democracy raised its head again in Serbia last Monday , the possibility of Serbia soon rejoining the European family is now a real possibility .
the results of the elections on 24 September have made a democratic change of direction possible .
I should like to congratulate everyone who helped to achieve it : the democratic opposition and , most importantly , the people and the leader of the democratic organisation , Mr Kostunica .
I think that , in him , we have a man who understands both the Serbs and our concerns and with whom we can discuss a qualified procedure for bringing Serbia closer to Europe .
since 24 September , Milosevic can no longer claim to be an elected ruler .
everyone , including his own citizens in Serbia now clearly see that he is a dictator , who is using all the brutal , ugly and contemptuous instruments of dictatorship in his own country .
special police units , dirty tricks and deception , quasi-legal procedures which he is using in a bid to hush up the fact that the people are sick and tired of him .
he has managed for years , with the help of his propaganda machine and by exerting brutal pressure on the media , to deceive the people in his own country and , unfortunately , many in the western world , to whom he has misrepresented the real situation .
at last , all that is at an end .
the people in Serbia have expressed their will in democratic elections and they are painfully aware of the fact that Milosevic has no intention of respecting this will and is thinking only of hanging on to power and maintaining his contemptuous regime .
which is why we must support Serbia in its bid for freedom .
those who have fought for peace in south-eastern Europe for years now and who are familiar with the situation in the region , know how difficult the fight against authoritarian rulers and tyrants in most of these countries was and , in places , still is .
sometimes we expect too much of the new people in power or we expect them to follow our views and our way of thinking , which do not fit in with their traditions and which are irreconcilable with their philosophy of life or alien to their mindset .
I should therefore like to state quite clearly that we shall soon have new contacts in Serbia , who may well not understand us immediately or who will perhaps misunderstand us , partly due to inexperience and partly due to the cultural or structural differences which I have mentioned .
I should like straight away to warn against interpreting any such initial difficulties in communicating with the newly elected president as a sign of irreconcilable differences between us and the advocates of democracy in Serbia .
there are no such differences .
we can help them on the path to Europe .
if we want to give the implementation of the stability pact a real boost after the imminent change of power in Serbia and push the so-called quick start packages through at long last , then we must do more than just talk .
I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to give a sign at long last and at least lift some sanctions , because these sanctions have made 200 000 people in Serbia richer and richer and 10 million people poorer and poorer .
please help us to give the people a glimmer of hope , with Kostunica , so that we can all nurse some hope for Serbia .
( applause )
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen . we are delighted to hear that the people of Yugoslavia , mainly in Belgrade but also in other towns , have known how to take their fate into their own hands and have done so .
however , our delight is tainted with fear that there may be bloodshed , that not everyone wants to and can accept the voice , power and strength of the people .
everything must therefore be done to prevent bloodshed , because a civil war in Yugoslavia or Serbia would be a veritable disaster .
Mr Dupuis , you have abused this truly historic moment here in order to engage in political demagogy .
I have only one thing to say to you : my group and I are unequivocally in favour of bringing Milosevic to justice before the court in the Hague .
that has always been our objective ; but we have a still higher objective , which is to avoid bloodshed and we shall do everything we can so that bloodshed is avoided .
the Commission and the Council will do their part and that is what is currently at the top of the agenda in Yugoslavia and that is what we have been interested in all along .
we shall not sacrifice the Serbian people to our noble and moral objectives , because that would mean that perhaps thousands of people in Serbia and Yugoslavia might die for them .
secondly , we are in a very delicate position and , therefore , we too trust that there will be fast changes in Yugoslavia and Serbia , because the situation is not easy in either Montenegro or Kosovo .
here , too , I have one thing to say : we have supported the efforts with which the people have defended themselves against the brutal force emanating from Milosevic in both Kosovo and Montenegro , but under no circumstances do we support the concept of ethnically clean states .
Kosovo must be independent come what may and Montenegro must be independent come what may , just to ensure that Serbia is weakened .
Madam President , despite his twisting and squirming we are probably seeing Milosevic &apos;s final moments in power .
it is a power that he has abused cynically and he is now trying to cheat democracy .
we are certain that Mr Milosevic will fall , possibly this evening , certainly soon .
what we are seeing on CNN is more than the fall of Milosevic .
it is the end of the dreary succession of 20th century European tyrants .
Serbia is suffering the final pangs of fascism on the fringes of our own Union .
we will all rejoice when that suffering is over .
as the drama concludes it is the duty of this Parliament , as a symbol of united free Europe , to support the crowds outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kostunica to achieve and fulfil the mandate .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is slightly bizarre that we should be discussing Serbia in this Chamber at a time when the Serbian parliament building is going up in flames and hundreds of thousands of people are on the streets .
despite this , I would like to make an attempt at explaining why I am positive and optimistic about the outcome at the moment .
there is of course the support of hundreds of thousands of people - the figure of one million has even been mooted - who are prepared at this moment to put themselves at risk in order to support the opposition and to help Mr Kostunica against the wishes of Mr Milosevic .
there are also the latest reports on the role of the police , which , as has been apparent for some time , have been in doubt as to whether to continue to support the regime , and which , as it appears from the first reports now coming in , have opted to side with the demonstrators ; according to the latest reports , the same could happen with the army .
there is also the fact that the chairman of the state broadcasting corporation has resigned , this being a signal , I believe , that he refuses to act as the extension and mouthpiece of the Milosevic regime any longer .
I would like to make two minor observations with regard to the future .
I wholeheartedly support the proposal and appeal by Doris Pack to reach the decision quickly , in fact as quickly as possible , to lift the sanctions , because these have done far more harm than good .
finally , I would like to propose that a delegation from Parliament visit Serbia at the earliest opportunity , and once a new Yugoslavian government has been installed , so that we , in tandem with this new government , can make plans for the reconstruction of a new Serbia .
Madam President , I am wondering how we can help democratic Yugoslavia , considering the way in which events appear to be , or we hope they are , unfolding now .
our group has confidence in our President and in the declaration which we have agreed she should make .
however , Madam President and Commissioner , we need more than pretty words .
do not say in general terms , &quot; Serbia belongs in Europe &quot; , which is , after all , something which you have only recently discovered .
we refer to Yugoslavia but it is no help to Mr Kostunica if we appear to be implying that Montenegro , for example , will secede .
and to ensure we do go beyond pretty words , do you intend to propose as quickly as possible that Yugoslavia , by that I mean democratic Yugoslavia , be included in the list of candidate countries for the enlargement of the European Union ?
we at least hope that you do .
Madam President , Slobodan Milosevic &apos; s latest polling box fraud comes as no surprise to us . it is an electoral manoeuvre which is ad nauseam reminiscent of an extremely poor political reputation .
precisely this unfeeling attitude is also making us fear the worst - and current events are bearing out the words written by myself only a few hours ago .
is the Yugoslav President really making way for his opponent and probably lawfully elected successor , Vojislav Kostunica , without any bloodshed ?
a pressing question indeed .
along with the Serbian population , the Western world would be only too happy with such a switch in power in Belgrade .
however , a sense of relief should not be attended by reckless carelessness .
the European Union and the United States are being warned about this from various quarters in the region .
they consider Kostunica - in terms of ideas - just as much a Great-Serbian nationalist as Milosevic , with all that entails for the Montenegrins and Kosovars .
in summary , should Kostunica take Milosevic &apos; s place , the West would do well to make aid strictly dependent on his concrete efforts to establish a constitutional state in Serbia and Yugoslavia .
Madam President , I hesitated before asking to speak again because I noticed that your press secretaries just handed you something and I thought perhaps you had received the latest news .
if you have not , I would be grateful if I might briefly read out the following release from the German press agency timed at 17.53 hours .
it says : several dozen members of the special police have joined with the demonstrators in Belgrade .
all the police deployed to guard the state television building stormed by the protestors , have laid down their combat weapons and have allied themselves with the demonstrators .
this was reported on Radio Index .
apparently at least one police station in the city centre has joined the protestors .
that was the latest at 17.53 hours .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is clear that today may well turn out to be a historic day in this Parliament , possibly ushering in the end of one of the last buttresses of a totalitarian dictatorship in Europe .
it is of course difficult to determine how long the Serbian population will need to continue fighting before Milosevic will actually disappear off the scene .
a unanimous stance on the part of the Serbian population has proved extremely important , as it will continue to do so for the next couple of days and weeks .
this means , at the same time , that the European Union too will very much need to form a united front .
in this context , I deplore the fact that the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs , fortunately abandoned by almost all parties in the Lower Chamber , adopted a stance out of the blue which goes against the unity of the European Union and against the wishes of the opposition in Serbia . I believe this displays a lack of earnestness , and is at the same time insulting to his office .
it also signals an excessive drive to stand out from the rest , to the point where the life of people could be at stake .
I believe it is also important to establish at this time on what basis the High Representative and the Council will need to adopt their positions .
will it be by largest common denominator , or on the basis of a large majority in the Council , which should not be difficult to achieve with regard to this issue ?
in addition to establishing unity in the Union , this is also , of course , about recognising the fact that Kostunica has won the presidential elections .
I wonder if the Commissioner has planned any steps in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people , and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved as from today .
naturally it is difficult to mention budgets at this early stage .
the High Representative explained this only a moment ago , but what we can do is to selectively lift sanctions by way of sending a message to the Serbian electorate .
the neighbouring countries will take a great interest in this too .
I hope that the Council , in conjunction with the Commission , will take clear measures in this respect in the short term .
it is not easy to gauge Serbia &apos; s future .
as we have already witnessed all over Central Europe , constitutional states and democracy do not blossom automatically after a revolution .
nationalism does not automatically disappear if a democratically elected president can be found .
we should therefore remain level-headed and focused in our attempts to create openings for a development which will bring Serbia nearer to Europe , also from a moral-political point of view .
the debate is closed .
I have received three motions for resolutions , pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
the vote will take place shortly .
vote
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is as a friend of Israel that I am explaining tonight why I have voted for the joint resolution .
indeed , while I regret a certain ambiguity in the wording and while I do not accept the failure to mention that there is a multitude of Palestinian groups prepared to do anything to wipe out the State of Israel and the Israelis by means of violence and war , it is my very friendship for the Israelis that makes me implore them to end the armed repression against children .
it is also my friendship for Israel and my esteem for the Palestinians that makes me implore them to do everything possible to achieve peace , even if that means great sacrifice on both sides .
their security and their medium- and long-term existence are at stake and no doubt world peace too , at this moment .
Mr President , if you will allow me , I would like to explain why I have abstained in the vote on the resolution regarding the Middle East .
I believe that in delicate matters such as these , preference should be given to a diplomatic stance and , as far as the specific content of Paragraph 4 is concerned , it does not comply with the standards for a balanced resolution , in my view .
especially with regard to the committee of inquiry , I would like to stress the fact that it should be an internationally constituted committee of enquiry and that its competences must be clearly delineated .
Mr President , there is a problem with the German urgent debate file - I do not know if the same applies to the other language versions - in that it only contains the proposed amendments of the GUE group but none of the motions for resolutions and not even the joint text .
that is a serious error .
if I had not been given information by Mrs Langenhagen , who is a first-class shipbuilding and shipping safety expert , I would not now know what I was supposed to be voting on .
please ensure that this does not happen again .
statement by the President on Yugoslavia
Mr President , I wish to comment on this morning &apos; s agenda , which , as you know , is particularly lean , even though extremely important events are taking place in Europe and it is most striking that we have held an entire part-session without having a single debate on the single currency .
last week , on 24 September , an extremely important referendum was held , in which the Danes rejected the single currency .
yesterday , the European Central Bank raised its intervention rates by a quarter of a point , which led to a further fall in the euro &apos; s value .
there are two conclusions to be drawn here . firstly , the public will never take any interest in our debates if Parliament persists in side-stepping discussions on every important issue .
secondly , the euro is an artificial currency and it would be a disaster to make a complete changeover to the euro in the present circumstances .
Mr President , I just wanted to draw attention to the huge pile of documents we needed for voting this week .
I would like to congratulate the honourable Members .
we have all been very industrious .

loans for projects in Croatia
Mr President , the European Investment Bank grants loans to non-EU countries , guaranteed by the European Union . the bank guarantees individual loans freely in accordance with its own criteria and not the precise guidelines laid down by the EU .
however , the Union has fixed a ceiling for the loans it guarantees .
the loans are not guaranteed one hundred percent and the Council decided in December 1999 to guarantee just 65 % of the final total for loans for the period 2000-2007 .
for the rest the bank must itself obtain other forms of security or cover the risk itself .
in practice there is no risk and the European Investment Bank would even be prepared to lower the percentage the EU guarantees .
there is a special Guarantee Fund in the Union budget for loans from the EIB .
for each guarantee , funds are transferred from a special reserve into the Guarantee Fund , with a maximum amount decided in the finance frameworks contained in the interinstitutional agreement .
in 2000 a maximum of 204 million euros can be transferred from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund .
technically 9 % of the sum for EIB loans should be transferred from the reserve into the Guarantee Fund , a figure representing 65 % of the nominal value of the loans .
the Guarantee Fund in the budget is also used for macroeconomic aid to non-EU countries .
it is a cheap way for the Member States to grant development aid .
these loans are granted on political grounds to the EU &apos; s humble partners and they are guaranteed one hundred percent by the Guarantee Fund , unlike the Investment Bank loans .
in macroeconomic aid it is often a question of the EU &apos; s share in an overall package in which other sources of aid are the World Bank and the IMF .
generally , financial aid to non-member countries is granted in accordance with the economic and political behavioural criteria set by the IMF - the more guarantees are given for Investment Bank loans , the less macroeconomic aid can be granted , and vice versa .
the Guarantee Fund can also be used to guarantee the Euratom loans to support the development of core industries in non-member countries , although no transfers from the reserves to the Guarantee Fund have had to be organised for these sorts of loans in recent years .
in December 1999 the Council decided the maximum amount for guarantees for the Investment Bank for the period 2000-2007 , and produced a list of non-member countries that would be entitled to receive aid .
the European Parliament adopted a position on the matter in a report by Mrs Rühle in autumn 1999 .
as Parliament has been heard , the matter is no longer being discussed in Parliament with regard to the terms and conditions of the guarantees .
Parliament must today decide a very simple matter : whether Croatia should join that group of countries to which the European Investment Bank may grant loans with an EU guarantee .
Croatia is no longer at war and democratic change has taken place there .
so there are good grounds for the country joining the group of borrowers , just as there are to increase the ceiling of the EIB mandate .
if Parliament could table amendments to the Council Decision it would certainly remind us of Croatia &apos; s unemployment and social problems , which are the result of that country being put on a slimming regimen , but there is no legal basis here for such amendments .
the same problem of legal competence will also apply in the decision to be discussed soon in Parliament regarding Turkey joining the group of those countries receiving loan guarantees given by the EU to the European Investment Bank .
Parliament is bound to have a lot of conditions it would like to impose on loans to Turkey , but at the time we will be making a decision in practice with regard to just one word .
today we add Croatia to the list of those receiving guarantees and then it will be Turkey &apos; s turn .
in this connection we will at the same time make it known to the Commission that next year the Guarantee Fund reserves will not be sufficient for guaranteeing the loans we can expect .
Mr President , this proposal for a Council decision with a view to extending , for the first time , the Community guarantee for the European Investment Bank undoubtedly has a truly extraordinary scope .
before commenting specifically on the issues raised by this proposal for a decision , I should like to express our support for it , since it endorses Parliament &apos; s position on relations between the European Union and Croatia .
for this very reason , I wish to state from the outset that I share the concerns expressed by the rapporteur a few minutes ago on the situation of the loan guarantee reserve , whose narrow margin could cause problems should any unforeseen events occur .
there is one decision that must be put in a dual context . we should consider Croatia &apos; s situation firstly from a strictly political point of view .
we must welcome the new political direction that is being taken there , following the legislative and presidential elections .
the European Union must encourage Croatia to remain firmly grounded in democracy and the rule of law and there is no doubt that this encouragement must be translated into action involving financial support to improve the economic situation there and to enable the Croatian people to make the necessary sacrifices to balance out the fundamental deficits in their public accounts .
from the operational point of view , I believe that both the loan guarantee reserve that has been provided for in the current financial perspective , and the functioning of the Guarantee Fund require an improvement in the mechanisms for achieving the objectives of quality and efficiency in Union loans that are given budgetary guarantees .
in this sense , the rapporteur &apos; s analysis strikes me as being an admirable starting point .
it does not seek to cast doubt on the budgetary protection plan nor on the role of the EIB .
the Interinstitutional Agreement provides for a series of three-part dialogues to take place within the budgetary procedure .
given this context and bearing in mind the narrow margin of the loan guarantee reserve , which is set at EUR 200 million per year , there is no reason why we should not discuss the priority uses of this margin in coming years .
our aim is clearly to improve the efficiency of the European Investment Bank . in order to achieve this , the Commission must ensure that the most thorough assessment possible of its activities will be carried out .
we cannot content ourselves with saying that we have a reliable system of guarantees .
in the budgetary procedure for 2001 , our political group has maintained a strategy of pursuing a marked improvement in the quality of expenditure and an improvement in the mechanisms for monitoring its performance .
it is time to call for the same objectives with regard to the activities of the EIB .
what is clear is that Parliament cannot restrict its role to passively assimilating the information supplied to it by the Commission and the EIB , or to giving its blessing to the decisions of the Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the report by the Committee on Budgets under discussion , which recommends extending the Community guarantee given to the European Investment Bank to loans granted to Croatia , deals with two important matters .
firstly , the political situation in Croatia has improved dramatically .
the new government is committed to political and economic reform .
that is an opportunity for the European Union to continue once more with cooperation , which was interrupted in 1995 when Croatia began military action in Krajina .
the other message is contained in Croatia &apos; s still very difficult economic situation .
for years the country practised an economic policy based on plundering , which has left the new government to shoulder the burden of a depressed business sector and an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .
the rapporteur , Esko Seppänen , says quite rightly in the explanatory statement in his report that social conditions in Croatia are difficult and the Community &apos; s contribution to the reform process should also have a positive impact on the social dimension .
an important political change was seen in Croatia in the parliamentary elections that were held earlier this year .
the country &apos; s inhabitants showed by voting that they demanded democratic change .
the new government was made up of a democratic frontline of six parties , which has a firm majority in the country &apos; s parliament .
the government has indicated it is rapidly recognising the values of European democracy and the rule of law .
in foreign relations it gives priority to the integration of a Euro-Atlantic framework .
in its programme , the government is committed to such matters as a respect for human rights and the rights of minorities , the repatriation of refugees , improved relations with its neighbours , and considerable economic reform .
legislation is already in place to achieve these aims .
developments in Croatia have swiftly led to closer relations between the EU and Croatia after a gap of several years .
between the Union and Croatia there is an advisory working party in place , whose purpose it is to offer Croatia expertise and technical assistance in negotiations on contractual relations .
according to the Commission , talks on the Stability and Association Pact with the country should be started as soon as possible .
the Council decided in August that the Tempus 3 programme , which relates to higher education , should extend to Croatia .
in July the Commission freed 10 million euros to support the repatriation of refugees .
the proposal under discussion contains a target figure of 250 million euros in EIB loans for Croatia for the period 2000-2007 .
with that sum , it is proposed to finance basic infrastructure projects and environmental investment , the development of industry and SMEs , housing reconstruction , urban renewal and tourism .
the plans are in accordance with projects that were put forward by Croatia at the Regional Funding Conference held in March .
Croatia &apos; s leaders are committed to difficult but necessary economic reform .
the cure will be hard to endure , but , hopefully , the loans now being spoken about will help to soften the negative effects of economic reform on the lives of the people .
we also have to remember that Croatia has good industrial manufacturing plants , a qualified and trained workforce and excellent opportunities for the development of tourism , for example .
according to a survey by the Commission the country &apos; s competitiveness in European markets could be strengthened enormously with a raft of consistently applied and ambitious structural reforms , but at present many Croatian businesses still have problems competing in the free economy .
the events in the Balkans and the future of the region are burning issues .
this week , in the wake of the Presidential elections , we have followed the situation in Yugoslavia with bated breath .
the winds of change are blowing in Belgrade too .
the international community has already indicated it will support the Serbian nation and sanctions are being lifted .
the European Union and the European Parliament have every reason to support positive developments in the Balkans .
instability in the region is a threat to Europe as a whole .
we know that nationalism and poverty mean war .
ahead of us there is a massive amount of physical and spiritual reconstruction to take place and we also , for our part , have to clear the barriers to effective assistance .
unfortunately , interinstitutional discussions on next year &apos; s budget - in particular section IV on financing - still appear to be very difficult for the time being .
hopefully , the signs of hope in Croatia and now also in Yugoslavia will encourage us to find a solution to the problems of the budget and its financial perspectives .
Mr President , last night we discussed the topic of Serbia and the revolutionary changes that are taking place there .
in somewhat less dramatic style , Croatia changed governments last year .
in any event , the election victory of the opposition was given the same recognition .
this is why it is possible to pick up where we left off in 1995 .
the chances of achieving a stabilisation and association agreement have now been looked into , and it is expected that negotiations on this topic will begin before the end of this year .
a delegation of the European Union has been primed for action , and as you know , the Summit at the end of November will take place precisely in Zagreb , in order to give Croatia the message that the country is welcome in European Union circles .
this is why it is necessary for the economy to be rebuilt .
in its recent past , Croatia has witnessed dramatic changes for the worse and widespread corruption .
let us not forget that , until recently , Croatia was the classic example of a privatisation programme which had got completely out of hand , and which benefited only one individual .
this whole process will need bolstering , which will require enormous investments - investments in infrastructure , in the environment , but also investments in very risky operations .
as we all know , setting up small and medium-sized businesses in that kind of country is risky .
things can go wrong , and this also applies to the reception of refugees , an investment goal which was lacking from the rapporteur &apos; s report , unfortunately .
these too are risky investments .
it is therefore only justified that the mandate of the European Investment Bank will be increased by 250 million .
the European Union is acting as guarantor .
but this is exactly where the problem lies , because we are now at the same point where we were last night when we were discussing the subject of Serbia , namely the fact that the Council underestimated the actual cost to be incurred in the Balkans last year in Berlin .
as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , I know that the members of the Committee on Budgets have criticised me and my colleagues for continually wanting more funds for the Balkans , and for having to enter into negotiations with the Council , which is not always that easy .
but there is very definitely a real problem .
I mentioned it yesterday when we were debating Serbia and I am repeating it here .
it is not acceptable that the rift between the pledges and promises made by the European Union on the one hand , and the reserved funding on the other hand , should be as huge as it is now threatening to become .
having spoken fine words yesterday and having granted this guarantee today , the European Union cannot afford to arrive in Belgrade empty-handed tomorrow .
I would therefore urge the fellow Members but also , and mainly , the Council , to stick as closely as possible to the Commission &apos; s proposal during the next couple of months of negotiations on the budget for next year and subsequent years , the reason being that , in my view , the proposal still provides the best estimate of the total cost in Croatia , but also in other parts of the Balkans .
I would now like to turn my attention to the overall programme for the Balkans .
I support the amendment by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , which is right in saying that this loan is important , but that , in the final analysis , the overall programme , given the necessary financial backing , is more important .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and explanatory comments .
I am sure we are all agreed that Croatia must be given political assistance , but political assistance also entails financial support , because political stability is always a prerequisite to social and economic stability . this can only be achieved , of course , if there is an appropriate level of investment in this sphere .
there is not a moment to lose if the fall in GDP recorded for 1999 and the increase in the budgetary deficit in Croatia are to be halted and reversed . in the final analysis , the only way to achieve this is through Croatia developing self-supporting economic cycles .
the contribution under discussion , which would take the form of an EIB loan in excess of EUR 250 million for the period from 2000 to 2007 , may not prove to be a milestone , but it would certainly help the process on its way .
the course of action proposed by the Commission and backed by the report is the inevitable outcome .
however , the problems that have come to light and which are as yet unresolved , are something else altogether .
it is generally the case that new political challenges demand increased financial outlay , but not - I might add - at the expense of others .
Mr President , living through these dramatic hours , we look to Belgrade and hope that a process of democratisation will get underway there which will present us with a real democracy in the course of the next few years .
yet there is still a huge question mark hanging over all this .
we want to support and welcome the process , but we must not get carried away .
Croatia started building a democracy as long as ten years ago .
democratic elections were held there in 1990 , which the international community deemed fair and free .
following these elections the former Communist government , under the leadership of the present Prime Minister , Mr Racan , stepped down in a disciplined manner and a new democratic development began under the Tudjman government . according to the international community though , a few cracks started to develop in this administration , and the situation went downhill from there .
we must now consider the bigger picture .
looking back , not only did this country have to rid itself of the burdensome legacy of fifty years of Communist government - and all Central and Eastern European States , including the candidate states still have their work cut out there - a third of this country was occupied by foreign troops under the dictator Milosevic , who held office at the time and is still in office today .
a third of Croatia was occupied , and it was many years before the country was reunited and a democracy established which - and this is a point worth emphasising - led to a peaceful change of government .
the current administration did not take over under the conditions faced by , what will hopefully be the future government in Belgrade , because the previous government in Croatia stepped down after free and fair elections , and then a new government took office .
it is therefore not quite accurate for the report to talk in terms of democratisation .
democratisation took place in Croatia ten years ago .
we must also recognise what remarkable achievements there have been over the past ten years in terms of building a market economy , democracy and a constitutional state .
Mr Langendijk is right , some colossal mistakes were made with privatisation .
there was corruption on a massive scale , but if you take a look round the associated countries , the candidate states , you will detect the same trend there .
the current democratic government in Croatia and its democratic opposition , need our full support .
I therefore welcome the fact that we are going to take the decision today to adopt the guarantee payments .
but we must be clear in our own minds that this is only a first step in the right direction .
Mr Markov was right to point out that funds are scarce , and that this can only be a first step .
our aim must be to forge ahead down this path , not just by providing more funds , but , above all , by sending out political signals .
to this end , we must at last conclude an Association Agreement with Croatia , which will spell out that this is a European country that has a definite future as a member of the European Union .
I therefore say &apos; yes &apos; to financial aid , and &apos; yes &apos; to this guarantee , but , at the same time , would call upon the Commission most emphatically to lend massive support to this deeply European , and now truly democratic and constitutionally governed country , and to include it in the list of candidate countries , because I believe Croatia has earned our full support .
this could send out a signal to the entire region and might lead to its rejuvenation .
Mr President , these days , we cannot talk about Croatia without seeing it in the context of its neighbour Serbia , where the people are now finally throwing off the yoke of the authoritarian government clique . a clique which referred to itself as socialist , but managed to stay in power for more than ten years by using fascist methods alone .
along with legal inequality for the opposition and overt state violence , this also manifested itself in the fact that fear was instilled in the people of Serbia vis-à-vis the big bad world outside and that people who criticised the regime were proclaimed traitor to their own country .
the same formula has been applied in Croatia over the past ten years . Croatia is not one of the states we have been discussing this week as being potential future candidate states of the Union .
in many respects , the position of that country is the same as that of Slovakia , which is now a candidate state .
up until 1918 , both regions were rebellious sections of Hungary and boasted their own language , culture and identity , but were thwarted by the official state authority .
international pressure forced them thereafter not to become fully independent , but to join new large collective states which were intended as melting pots for minor Slavonic peoples , but they never managed to integrate properly .
when half a century ago , Croatia and Slovakia became nominally independent for the first time , they became vassals of the Hitler regime .
in 1945 , the outside world agreed that these states should cease to exist permanently .
with the benefit of hindsight , this was a silly move .
ignoring the wish of those peoples to be able to make independent decisions , provided the breeding ground for aggressive and authoritarian nationalism for years , a nationalism which had little consideration for the tragic legacy left by the Nazi era and which was hostile towards other peoples and democracy at home .
people hid behind Tudjman and Meciar because they saw this as the only guarantee for being treated as equals vis-à-vis their neighbours who used to rule over them .
it is only now that all their reasonable demands have been met and nobody doubts the right to independence any longer , that nationalism is fading away and normal political alliances are emerging .
the nationalists recently lost political power in both countries .
this could serve as a lesson for other strongly nationalist regions .
the only way to eradicate nationalism is to meet all reasonable demands of those nationalists .
there is now every reason for treating Croatia in the same way as Slovakia and other Central European countries which can join the European Union if they so wish .
the damage done by the war has not yet been cleared , as we witnessed recently .
the country &apos; s road infrastructure is vulnerable because Dalmatia and Slavonia form the two halves of a pair of scissors , as it were , with Bosnia being wedged in the middle , which , particularly in West Herzegovina , is also populated by Croats .
the environment in the large population concentrations in Zagreb , Rijeka and Osijek is at risk .
this set of circumstances will probably necessitate huge investments , which will not be repaid until later on in the form of tourism and new industry .
this is why it would be useful to make the necessary arrangements at this stage .
along with the rapporteur , I do wonder whether the funds will be made available in real terms , especially now it appears that Serbia will also be needing large funds shortly and the Union &apos; s budget is not being increased .
there is little point in the European Union making pledges to crisis areas and candidate states left , right and centre , which it cannot meet .
as far as Croatia is concerned , there is every reason to set up a financial arrangement .
the comment which my colleague Mr Papayannakis made yesterday about admitting Serbia to the European Union should also apply to Croatia .
there is another individual measure that has been well received today .
of course we cannot consider the issue of guarantee payments and the issue of Croatia separately from the debate that took place yesterday evening and the developments in Belgrade .
we must immediately appeal to the military and the police , in no uncertain terms , to throw their full weight behind democracy , and do all they can to ensure that this changeover of power - which was triggered by the outcome of democratic elections - proceeds peacefully over the next few hours .
we have every intention of recognising these democratic elections and the electoral victory of Vojislav Kostunica .
of course my country , Austria , in common with all the other European countries , will also have to do its bit towards the reconstruction of Yugoslavia , in tandem with the European Union .
we will also do everything in our power to ensure that the anticipated removal of sanctions against former Yugoslavia is implemented in full .
our honourable friend , Mr Posselt , was correct in what he said about the developments in Croatia .
but we are all agreed , nonetheless , that the parliamentary and presidential elections that took place in January 2000 have produced a new political climate .
the new government has reinforced its commitment to political and economic reform .
this will have a positive effect on relations between Croatia and the EU .
the European Union &apos; s response to this development has been not only to appoint the advisory EU-Croatia Task Force , but also to develop the office of the special representative in Zagreb into a permanent representative office of the European Commission .
in the feasibility report on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia , compiled in May 2000 , the Commission reaches the conclusion that the conditions for taking up negotiations with Croatia have been fulfilled .
the delegations from the Croatian Parliament and from our own , have also called upon the Council to extend the EIB mandate .
the Council held in June established that all the preconditions to commencing negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement had been meet .
in July , the European Commission forwarded the draft of a negotiating mandate to the Member States , for them to comment on .
Austria , the country I come from , was one of the first three Member States , to make a positive statement .
the reason I mention this development in the year 2000 , after the election , is because it shows that we need to do more than increase the guarantee fund .
we have already come a long way .
we must single-mindedly pursue the process that started in May and July as far as an Association Agreement .
Croatia and the region deserve this in the interests of peace within Europe .
Mr President , first of all I must declare a personal interest , I have a son-in-law who was , and is , a refugee from the Krajina in Croatia .
even if it is now technically possible to return , much more has to be done to make the return of Serbs to Croatia and the Krajina in particular positively welcome .
much physical restoration is required in that sad part of Croatia .
we in the European Union must insist that this is positively encouraged and not just a nominal gesture .
our financial contributions should be on that condition and I would appreciate a reassurance from the Commission that this aspect will be taken into account .
my second point refers to Serbia itself .
even if there is the happy , democratic outcome , which we hope for in Serbia , there will still be great resentment resulting from what happened with the Kosovo campaign and our recent relationships with Serbia .
this will not be overcome immediately .
we in Europe must be prepared to rise above any peevish reactions to those sentiments .
the top priority , not just for Serbia but for all the Balkans including Bulgaria and Romania , is to restore normal transport links in the whole area and bring Serbia with all its hurts back into the European fold .
I am grateful , on behalf of the Commission , to Mr Seppänen for his report relating to the proposal to extend the existing Community guarantee for European Investment Bank lending outside the Union to cover interventions in Croatia .
as the House will know and as has been remarked again this morning , the parliamentary and presidential elections early this year resulted in the change of government in Croatia and brought a new political climate .
we celebrate that and we act as a Community to support it .
but I cannot let this debate pass without referring to another part of former Yugoslavia which is beginning the century with hope and the prospect of freedom .
I am speaking of the glorious revolution taking place now in Serbia , thanks to the courage of the Serbian people and their insistence on democracy .
the House will know that the Commission has made it crystal clear that European Union sanctions will stop with the advent of democratic government in Serbia .
when it appears that Milosevic has fled and the will of the people has prevailed , we hope that action to establish normal relations and partnership between Serbia and this Union of democracies will only be days away .
meanwhile the new government in Croatia is clearly demonstrating its serious commitment to putting that country on a secure democratic path and to implementing the political and economic reforms necessary to adhere to the conditions of the European Union stabilisation and association process for the western Balkans .
taking account of those advances last May , the Commission produced a positive feasibility report on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Croatia and on 19 July recommended opening negotiations .
this constitutes a major step forward in EU-Croatia bilateral relations .
the Commission hopes that a decision can be taken in November so that negotiations can start without too much delay .
it is also essential for the Community to provide appropriate financial support for Croatia .
the resumption of EIB lending is intended to assist the country &apos;s investment activities in infrastructure and private sector development .
the new Croatian leadership clearly needs dependable and sustained backing to pursue demanding reforms .
the proposal before the House would cover up to EUR 250 million of lending over the next four years .
as Mr Purvis has just said - and I fully acknowledge - that must be regarded as part of a process of normalisation , stabilisation and progress that extends over many years .
the rapporteur has not proposed any amendments .
I therefore thank him and the House for supporting this useful and progressive proposal as an investment in stable democracy in yet another part of our continent .
( applause )
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
explanations of vote
Mr President , I wanted to be here not just to state that I voted for this aid for Croatia but , above all , to have the chance to express my satisfaction , as others have today , at the democratic events taking place in Serbia at the moment .
after many years of difficulties for this people - all kinds of difficulties - we are at last , extremely democratically , beginning to welcome Serbia back into the community of the peoples of the European Union .
I hope that negotiations will soon get underway and , as with Croatia , that aid will also be granted to the Serbian people , who deserve our greatest respect .
thank you , Mr Fatuzzo .
adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( the sitting was closed at 9.45 a.m. )
resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 6 October 2000 .
approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
the Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
Madam President , the Minutes of the Parliamentary sitting tell us that the issue was raised in this Chamber of the racist attack made on a teacher in Verona .
the Minutes also say that Parliament condemned the incident and , in particular , expressed its solidarity with the teacher .
I would like to inform you that the teacher in question invented the whole story and has confessed that he was not the victim of an attack at all but that his wounds were self-inflicted .
what this amounts to is that we have all been taken for a ride .
I just wanted to inform you of this , seeing that this hoodwinking of Parliament by the teacher from Verona is recorded in the Minutes .
Mr Speroni , this information does not , most probably , require any amendment to the Minutes , but I take note of your comment nonetheless .
are there any further comments on the Minutes ?
( the Minutes were approved )
statements by the President
ladies and gentlemen , as you know , since our last part-session , a fortnight ago , three more people have been shot and killed by ETA .
let me mention their names and , in commemorating them , express our compassion and sympathy at this time of sadness to the members of their families : Luis Portero , Chief Public Prosecutor of the Regional Court of Andalucia , murdered in Granada on 9 October ;
Antonio Munos Carignanos , a Colonel and doctor in the Spanish air force , murdered in Seville on 16 October ;
Maximo Casado , a prison service employee , murdered yesterday morning in Vitoria .
it is on behalf of the whole House that I express our most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to the families and friends of these people .
these victims take the number of ETA murder victims since the cease-fire was broken on 3 December 1999 to a total of sixteen .
even if we cannot find the words to express our response to such a tragedy , we must not give up the fight by any means .
quite the opposite .
as we have always done on each of these sad occasions , we must , once again , condemn this intolerable behaviour .
the right to life is sacrosanct .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , which was approved in Biarritz by unanimous decision of the Heads of State and Government , reaffirms this most categorically .
I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , to pay tribute to these victims by observing a minute &apos; s silence , and to lend our support to the authorities and to democrats in Spain in their fight against this scourge , a fight that often puts their lives in jeopardy .
thank you for observing a minute &apos; s silence .
( the House rose and observed a minute &apos; s silence )
o
o o
President .
unfortunately , I must again take the floor to pay tribute to the memory of all those who have been victims of the upsurge of hatred and xenophobia in the Middle East .
tomorrow , this House will discuss this sensitive issue as part of its debate on the Biarritz European Council , but today I should just like to express my deep sadness at a phenomenon that we find disturbing in the extreme , since it is a tragic illustration of the baleful influence of the extremists on both sides .
on behalf of all the Members of this House , I would express our deepest sympathies to all the members of the families of the victims of this conflict , and further express my solidarity with all the people wounded in the conflicts .
I hope , moreover , that the advocates of peace and dialogue will ultimately succeed in prevailing over those that incite to violence and hatred .
o
o o
President .
finally , as you know , several days ago , torrential rain caused unprecedented damage in Switzerland and Italy , resulting in the deaths of twenty-five people , injuring many more , and occasioning extensive material damage .
the day before yesterday , in Spain , heavy rain and flooding was also to blame for the deaths of three people , with three others reported missing .
I should like , on behalf of the European Parliament , to express our distress at these events and to offer the families of the victims our deepest sympathy . if you agree , I shall once again ask you to observe a minute &apos; s silence in honour of these victims .
( the House rose and observed a minute &apos; s silence )
... I explained , then , that speakers on procedural motions would be cut off after one minute , as expressly stipulated in the Rules of Procedure , in Rule 141 , to be precise .
I should just like to point that out .
your applause today , as well as the applause I heard on the Tuesday of the last part-session , confirms that you endorse this approach .
Madam President , it is quite right that the municipal elections in Himara were marked by violence and fraud at the expense of the Greek minority living there .
that this happened is beyond question .
we have the findings of international organisations which monitored the elections .
Albania is a country whose own minorities have suffered persecution at the hands of other countries and , as we all know , the international community reacted to this persecution .
it should not repeat inside its borders what it suffered outside its borders ; that is , I think , the first lesson in democracy which we should bring to the attention of this country , which is starting to establish an internal democracy .
I should like the European Parliament to take note of these violations and , of course , to call for repeat elections in Himara .
we will make an appeal on Tuesday and Wednesday and collect the names and signatures of those women who wish to be part of the delegation . our intention is to build bridges of peace between women in places where violence prevails .
Madam President , I would just like to inform the two Greek speakers that the next meeting of the South-Eastern Europe delegation - in the course of which we will also receive representatives from Albania - will also address this issue , and I am certain that with Mrs Pack in the chair , we will approach the matter objectively .
Madam President , last week , the MEP Karla Peijs was attacked in Brussels .
I would urge you to approach the Belgian Government again and to see to it that security levels are stepped up in Brussels .
indeed , Mr Rübig , I shall do so .
Madam President , I have a question concerning the Statute for Members .
my question is : who is speaking for the European Parliament concerning this Statute ?
I ask because when I read the public statements made by our colleague , Mr Rothley , I get the impression that we have appointed a saboteur and not a rapporteur .
I hope that you are speaking for Parliament rather than Mr Rothley .
Madam President , I understand that you will shortly be announcing the decision of the French Government to terminate my mandate as a Member of the European Parliament .
I believe that this is a grave injustice and a penalty which is out of all proportion to the minor incidents which served as a pretext for it .
I received no notice in order to prepare my defence .
I was not permitted to waive my parliamentary immunity and I did not have the benefit of any of the defences that even a guilty party would have .
I believe that the European Parliament has the opportunity in this case to , perhaps , demonstrate its ability to come to the defence of its own dignity .
Madam President , there are more victims of ETA , but there are also more victims of the Spanish repression : more arrests , more people tortured , new dispersals of political prisoners jailed in the Basque country .
all in all there has been more suffering for Basques and Spaniards ; certainly the Spaniards and Basques are fed up with the present conflict .
it is not surprising if they express their profound dismay more and more clearly because , with the exception of the Spanish Government , no one believes in the benefits of the ongoing strategy .
can the European Parliament give up hope of ever finding a democratic . . .
( the President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , I do not wish to be repetitive , but the situation requires it .
you are aware of the situation in Campo de Gibraltar , where there is a damaged British nuclear submarine .
as we have feared and supposed since the start , according to the technicians , the significance of the damage is increasing daily with the passage of time .
I ask you , Madam President , to do everything possible to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions concerning a protest document that has been presented by more than thirty social groups and NGOs against this situation , in which there has been a blatant failure to comply with Community regulations on radiation protection .
Madam President , firstly , I would like to speak as chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to point out , following on from what Mr Haarder said , that Mr Rothley , first Vice-Chairman of the Committee , is not a spokesman but a rapporteur , and I think that so far he has conducted himself impeccably within that mandate .
secondly , I would like to speak in support of Mrs Morgantini &apos; s motion .
I think we are at a stage in the process in the Middle East in which dialogue between Palestinian and Israeli female Members of Parliament and European female Members of Parliament could contribute to resolving this conflict .
Madam President , if I have understood correctly , we are at present establishing our Agenda .
our Rules of Procedure do not admit any points of order at this juncture .
according to the Rules of Procedure , we are allowed procedural motions pursuant to Rule 141 and points of order with reference to the Rules of Procedure pursuant to Rule 142 , but not , in any manner of speaking , points of order , especially not to make the kind of representations we have just heard .
apparently , just anyone can stand up and say whatever they want when the Agenda comes up .
when oh when , Madam President , are you going to apply the Rules of Procedure and nothing but the Rules of Procedure ?
let me answer you , Mr Goebbels .
this is a problem that everyone chairing a sitting has to deal with .
the problem is determining whether a matter is grounds for a procedural motion or not .
I feel that if we stop to discuss whether , every time a Member wishes to speak on a procedural motion , it actually complies with the Rules of Procedure or not , then we shall waste a great deal of time .
I think applying the minute rule is the least damaging solution , in the final analysis , as we have , in fact , seen .
Madam President , you will recall that at the last part-session I raised the plight of the British democracy campaigner , James Mawdsley , who was held illegally by the Burmese authorities .
you promised to convey your concern , and subsequently this House passed a resolution condemning his imprisonment .
that was part of a concerted diplomatic effort and the House will be pleased to have learned that Mr Mawdsley was released by the Burmese authorities last week .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank you and Members of this House for the part you played in seeing this process through to a successful conclusion .
I hope that we can return before too long to the question of the thousands of other people who are political prisoners in Burma and the lack of democracy which afflicts that country .
Madam President , when my fellow Danish MEP , Mr Bertel Haarder , spoke a little while ago , his Danish was so garbled that it was completely impossible to understand what he was saying .
could you not make sure that we can hear what he is saying in future ?
it was really difficult to understand his Danish .
Madam President , last Monday , Antonio Russo , the Radio Radicale correspondent , was found dead in Georgia with his chest caved in . he was the only Western journalist to remain in Pristina , in Kosovo , for a number of weeks last year .
the autopsy performed in Georgia revealed that he was the victim of murder and had , in all probability , been tortured .
Antonio Russo , a courageous journalist , was investigating the crimes taking place in Chechnya , and it is our opinion that this was the reason for his tragic death .
I know that it would not be usual for Parliament to hold another minute &apos;s silence - and I would not be so bold as to propose this - but I wanted you to be informed of the development , for Antonio Russo was a journalist and a very brave man who gave his life for the freedom of information for all people .
Madam President , pursuant to the second paragraph of Rule 7 ( 4 ) of our Rules of Procedure , the President is bound to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market before ratifying the decision of the French Government .
the Council of State ruling , which you will perhaps be invoking as a defence very shortly , was issued by a body which has no jurisdiction in the matter , whereas French law stipulates that only plenary is competent to rule on the subject of the mandate of a Member of the European Parliament .
in the course of this procedure , Madam President , the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member , Jean-Marie Le Pen , has been violated from start to finish .
I do not see how you can cite the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as you did a short time ago , without actually implementing it in the exercise of your office .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the topic of violence is given priority status in this Parliament and that is how it should continue to be .
further to your appeal and your expression of sympathy with the families of the victims of violence , we too would like to show our solidarity with all those who are protesting today against the violence of ETA in so many places in the Basque country .
that is why , after approval of this agenda , we intend to hold a small , peaceful demonstration , which will take a few minutes , in front of the Parliament building , together with all colleagues and delegates in this House who wish to attend .
Madam President , it is not possible to let Mr Gollnisch impugn the supreme administrative court in France without responding . if he respected the rule of law , he would respect its jurisdiction .
as for Mr Le Pen , what an affront to the dignity of the European Parliament and for any true democrat to hear Mr Le Pen using the word &apos; dignity &apos; !
Madam President , I have a genuine point of order .
we have no urgent procedures this week , yet , Chechnya , Albania , Burma and Palestine have already been discussed .
my question to you is this : can we not change the Rules of Procedure in such a way that we no longer have urgent procedures , but deal with these matters at the beginning of the sittings instead ?
( applause )
do you see , Mr Goebbels ? is this actually a procedural motion or not ?
believe me , we could spend hours and hours debating the point .
Madam President , between 3 October 2000 and yesterday , at least seven memorials were desecrated , eight people were subjected to racist attacks , four hostels for asylum seekers were set upon , and seven synagogues , Jewish cemeteries or memorials were desecrated in the Federal Republic of Germany .
just because , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are supposed to be discussing the order of business does not mean that we have to take orders as to our business .
a number of Members of Parliament have had a fantastic dream , this I can understand .
they have dreamt of building the kind of federal state envisaged by Chairman Spinelli , for instance , or turning our Treaties into a constitution .
well , today , acknowledging that the jurisdiction of the European Parliament is subject to a State , regardless of which one this is , and has a bounden duty to terminate the mandate of one of our fellow Members , would be to admit that Parliament is not a sovereign assembly and must yield to national legal or government authorities .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have the opportunity to take a great step towards your dream , one I do not , however , personally share .
simply by acknowledging that the European Parliament has the discretionary power to settle the matter of the termination of the mandate , you will have gone some way towards achieving your federal dream . otherwise , Madam President , in yielding to the authority of others , you are effectively taking a step backwards .
a whole series of violations of the law - not just French law , but also European law - have taken place and I feel it would be a grave mistake not to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market or to hear Mr Le Pen &apos; s side of the case .
agenda
the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 19 October 2000 has been distributed .
relating to Monday : I have received a request from the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance to defer Mrs Klass &apos; s report , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine , to a later part-session .
Mr Lannoye wishes to speak as the author of this request .
Madam President , Mrs Klass &apos; s report has already been deferred twice .
we would , however , like to request that it be deferred for a third time for political reasons .
the fact is , this apparently technical report , which does not seem to make any great changes of a political nature , is extremely important insofar as it introduces the possibility of carrying out genetic engineering in viticulture and hence ending up with genetically modified viticulture .
we think , given that for the moment we are at the conciliation stage with regard to the framework directive on GMOs , that it would be wiser to await the conclusion of these conciliation proceedings and to deal with this problem once the framework has been clearly defined , which should , in principle , be in the month of January .
we therefore propose postponing examination of this report .
Mr Lannoye has just presented his Group &apos; s request .
is there a speaker to support this request ?
Madam President , as we have already told the rapporteur and the House repeatedly , there is an important piece of legislation on the release of genetically manipulated or modified micro-organisms , namely the report by David Bowe , which we are currently dealing with in the conciliation procedure .
this is the fundamental piece of legislation and it forms the basis for any other piece of legislation governing genetically modified plants .
it is therefore only sensible , and indeed , right and proper , to wait until the end of the conciliation procedure , which will not be for another six weeks or so , and then take decisions on all the other pieces of legislation .
I therefore support Mr Lannoye &apos; s amendment .
we shall now hear from the rapporteur , Mrs Klass , who , I believe , is opposed to postponing the report .
Madam President , I am against postponing the report , and I question the way in which this House works .
the report was adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development by a good majority and with only two votes against .
we are now embarking on a discussion about the release directive 90 / 220 , which is inappropriate .
we are referring here to the release directive , and according to the conciliation procedure , that is precisely what the speeches will focus on .
we are doing exactly the same as we have already done in the case of forest and plant material , i.e. we are making reference to the horizontal directive .
not voting on the report will lead to delays .
it will obstruct the trade in vine material in Europe , and so I believe that in the interests of the single market for Europe &apos; s vine propagators , we must vote on our report .
( Parliament rejected the request )
relating to Tuesday :
Madam President , on behalf of my Group , I would like to move that a particular item be included in tomorrow morning &apos; s debate , namely a statement from the Commission about an interview that Commissioner Verheugen gave to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last Friday , 20 October .
Mr Verheugen gave the impression that , according to the current state of play , the European Union will have ten new members by 2005 and , what is more , and this is more disturbing still , he called into question the significance of majority decisions in the Council of Ministers , which is what we regard as the fundamental reform element to be dealt with at the Nice Summit .
he has already been criticised within his own political circles for saying this .
we would urge the Commission to clarify matters tomorrow in its statement .
regrettably , this is now the second time that Commissioner Verheugen has said such contentious things .
he is obviously making a habit of putting his foot in it .
we urge the Commission to clarify its position .
Mr Poettering , in tomorrow &apos; s debate , every speaker will be free to raise any issue and to address both the Council and the Commission .
announcement of the removal of Mr Le Pen from office
ladies and gentlemen , I must inform you that on Thursday , 19 October 2000 , I received official notification from the competent authorities of the French Republic of a ruling by the Council of State on 6 October 2000 rejecting the appeal lodged by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen against the decree of the French Prime Minister on 31 March 2000 terminating his mandate as an elected representative to the European Parliament .
I must inform you that , since that time , I have received a copy of a request for clemency for Mr Le Pen presented to Mr Jacques Chirac , President of the French Republic , by Mr Charles de Gaulle , Mr Carl Lang , Mr Jean-Claude Martinez and Mr Bruno Gollnisch .
I shall give the floor to Mrs Ana Palacio Vallelersundi , chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , to give us her views on the matter .
Madam President , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , having deliberated at its sitting of 15 and 16 May , agreed to recommend that the announcement in plenary of Parliament &apos; s confirmation of the removal of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen &apos; s mandate be suspended .
I repeat , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market recommended that this announcement be suspended until the deadline period that Mr Le Pen was given for appealing against the French Council of State had expired or until a decision by the latter .
and I am quoting word for word from the letter dated 17 May that you yourself , Madam President , read in plenary .
as you said , the Council of State rejected the appeal and we were duly informed of that rejection .
there is therefore no longer any reason for delaying this announcement in plenary , which is an obligatory act according to primary law , specifically paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the Act of 20 September 1976 .
the request for a reprieve that you mentioned , Madam President , does not alter this situation , as it is not a legal appeal .
as its name indicates , it is an act of the Prince , which does not affect the decree from the French Government which , in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , must be announced in plenary .
thank you , Mrs Palacio .
consequently , pursuant to Article 12 ( 2 ) of the Act of 20 September 1976 on the election of representatives to the European parliament by direct universal suffrage , the European Parliament hereby takes note of the notification by the French Government of the termination of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen &apos; s mandate .
Mr Le Pen , please leave the Chamber forthwith . in order to ensure that these proceedings go ahead in an orderly manner without affecting the dignity of either this House or your own dignity , I propose to suspend the sitting for ten minutes .
( the sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m. )
request for waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s immunity
the next item is the report ( A5-0304 / 2000 ) by Mr MacCormick , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the request for the waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s immunity .
Madam President , this issue arises from a request ( announced by yourself to the House on 17 February ) by the appropriate Portuguese authorities seeking a waiver of the immunity of Mr Pacheco Pereira in respect of proceedings in Portugal concerning words spoken on a television programme some years ago .
the television programme involved a discussion about the respective roles of politicians and journalists .
Mr Pacheco Pereira in that debate made remarks about a third party not participating in the debate , to which the third party took exception .
initially , public criminal proceedings were initiated but these were dropped and there is now a private action taking place before the Cascais First Criminal Court .
this is therefore a case involving the exercise of freedom of speech in a political matter .
the immunities of Members of the House arise under Article 10 of the Protocol of the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities .
the substance of this , for our present purpose , is that Members of this Parliament enjoy in their own Member State the same immunities as would be enjoyed by members of the national parliament of the state in question .
the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , having looked into the matter , is satisfied that , upon an issue of the kind before us , Mr Pacheco Pereira , were he a member of the Portuguese Parliament , would enjoy immunity which could be waived only by the Portuguese Parliament .
therefore , under our rules , he enjoys immunity which can be waived only by decision of this Parliament .
it is important that I should underline the point that immunity is not conceived as an advantage to a particular Member , which she or he may waive or assert as she or he chooses .
rather , it is an immunity asserted by this House as a whole , in the interests of preserving the conditions of effective , democratic politics and argument and of enabling this House , through its Members , to discharge its function properly in an all-Europe democracy .
therefore it is for the House to decide whether the immunity ought to waived or not .
we do not do this arbitrarily .
we do it in accordance with precedence and practice established over many years .
the concluding section of my report ought to be read out : &quot; it is indisputable that Dr Pacheco &apos; s comments on a television programme on the press qualify as part of a political debate and therefore Paragraph 1 of Article 157 of the Portuguese constitution would be applicable .
under that provision he would have enjoyed immunity were he a member of the Portuguese Parliament .
accordingly , he does enjoy immunity as a Member of the European Parliament in respect of statements made and opinions expressed in the television programme to which the case relates . &quot;
it has been the practice of the House to insist upon upholding immunity in all cases where to deny it would be to inhibit political activity of a legitimate and democratic kind .
on that ground , therefore , the Legal Affairs Committee has unanimously come to the conclusion that , after considering the reasons militating for or against the waiver of immunity , we recommend that the immunity of Mr Pacheco Pereira not be waived by Parliament .
Madam President , the case of Mr Pacheco Pereira has been carefully examined by the Legal Affairs Committee : the recommendation , which was approved and which is tabled before the House today , is not to reject the request for waiver of Parliamentary immunity .
the reference made in the Protocol to national legislation does not mean that the European Parliament is being passed over but is in connection with the procedure , while every Parliament - including , in the case in point , the European Parliament - preserves its authority in its autonomous decisions .
when all is said and done , Mr Pacheco Pereira was performing a political activity and cannot therefore be considered responsible for any crime .
that is the position of the European People &apos; s Party . we would also like to point out that , if Mr Pacheco Pereira had been Italian , proceedings would have been brought against him without the European Parliament knowing anything about it .
the Italian judiciary does not ask for authorisation when the person in question is a Member of the European Parliament and ignores every principle of the respect due to this institution .
some Members of Parliament have already been taken to court during this parliamentary term without a request being put forward for waiver of parliamentary immunity .
personally , I was not able to intervene to condemn these actions in that it concerned members of my own party who have always been political targets , and my involvement would therefore have appeared exploitative .
however , the incident has been repeated again , and this time , although the Member concerned is a member of the European People &apos; s Party , he is not from the same political party or persuasion as I am in Italy .
proceedings were brought against Mr Cocilovo without Parliament being informed , indeed in contempt of Parliament .
this is an extremely serious matter , Madam President , that you cannot ignore .
the autonomy of the European Parliament is at stake !
Madam President , I certainly do not require the two minutes allocated to me because , after the explanation from Mr MacCormick and the additional explanation by Mr Zappalà , from the point of view of the Group of the Party of European Socialists of the European Parliament , there is no doubt that Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s immunity should not be waived .
I would say that this is a really trivial issue , a few comments by a politician on a television programme , which have resulted in a criminal action that has no grounds , and which are covered by the Portuguese constitution and by application of Community rules on the waiver of parliamentary immunity .
in short , here we have all the ingredients for Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s parliamentary immunity not to be waived and , therefore , the Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees with Mr MacCormick &apos; s proposal that Mr Pacheco Pereira &apos; s parliamentary immunity should not be suspended .
social policy agenda
the next item is the report ( A5-0291 / 2000 ) by Mrs Van Lancker , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the Commission communication to the Council , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the social policy agenda &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 379 - C5-0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 ( COS ) &#93; .
it has often been said that &apos; social policy is a productive factor &apos; and this is true , for a society with greater social cohesion is also a society which performs better .
however , social policy does have its own rights ; social policy must ensure that inequalities are ironed out , that social cohesion is promoted and that people &apos; s quality of life improves .
that is why this social agenda deserves a far more prominent position in European policy .
the Lisbon Summit has given us the opportunity to lend more weight to social policy ; we must seize that opportunity with both hands .
it was with great delight that I noted that the Commission and the French Presidency want an ambitious social agenda , and I believe , Commissioner and Minister , that we fully endorse the objectives .
I would therefore like to use some of my speaking time in this debate to draw attention to a number of points which Parliament would like to reinforce in this agenda .
the first point relates to the strategy . the social agenda must raise the profile of social Europe among the citizens , and that is why we are in favour of defining measures , priorities and instruments more clearly and with greater intensity .
we must be able to see where progress is being made ; this progress must be measurable and the social agenda must be afforded centre stage in the political discussion at European level .
hence our urgent appeal in favour of the introduction of a social scoreboard , similar to the one already in use in the internal market , which details specific measures , expiry dates and deadlines .
hence also our appeal in favour of having social agenda discussions at the annual spring Summit .
secondly , I would like to comment on the instruments .
it is true that the open method of coordination , which has been used within the sphere of employment since Luxembourg , has brought fantastic new openings in fields which up to now were only subject to national authority .
we would therefore ask that this method be reinforced and , as has now been decided by the Social Affairs Council , be applied to combat social exclusion and poverty .
furthermore , we would very much like to see this major innovative method being deployed to make progress in the modernisation strategy of social security .
thirdly , there is a &apos; but &apos; .
stressing the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method should replace social legislation , because we should lay down social rights in Europe too . we should have the nerve to formulate minimum social standards and draft social legislation which is necessary within the framework of a European internal market .
Parliament is of the opinion that the Commission could lend a helping hand here and there , for example where individual and collective workers &apos; rights are concerned , where more security in new types of labour are concerned , or as regards the protection of health and safety relating to new risks in the workplace .
in addition , we believe it is crucial that the European Commission should take the initiative to re-establish the link with the &apos; 92 recommendations in order to underpin Member States &apos; efforts to guarantee everyone a right to a reasonable income .
only then can the fight against poverty be efficient .
needless to say , the social partners are major players when it comes to achieving this agenda , where lifelong learning is concerned for example , or the organisation of working time , and new forms of work , and we hope that they will be prepared to negotiate within all these fields .
however , Commissioner , if this consultation does not yield results , we would also ask the Commission to use its right of initiative to the full .
I would like to finish off by making two remarks : as we endeavour to achieve the European social agenda it is essential to establish a close partnership , a partnership between institutions , and with the Member States , the social partners , but also with the many social NGOs which have a key role to play in the realisation of the agenda .
here too , we believe that Europe should take an initiative as a matter of urgency to reinforce this dialogue with the citizens and the dialogue with the social NGOs .
finally , social policy should not be viewed in isolation . it must be integrated into all EU policies .
I am convinced that Europe will only be social when a social dimension is added to economic policy , competition policy , external policy and the entire enlargement discussion .
I hope , Minister , that the Council will be inspired by Parliament &apos; s expectations , and I hope that you will succeed in setting ambitious goals at the Nice Summit for a European social agenda , which we can work towards together over the next couple of years .
Mr President , the proposed social agenda sent out a political message which did not go unheeded .
this issue provoked intense interest in societies throughout Europe and the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights has taken account in its opinion of the numerous proposals submitted by representatives of non-governmental organisations and civil society in general .
we hope that the application of the social agenda will also give citizens the chance to feel part of social Europe and to realise that the European Union intends to take positive action to continue raising standards of living , rather than merely guaranteeing minimum levels .
the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights also proposes that women of all ages and from all social strata should have access to an adequate and dignified system of social protection .
we must not forget that women are always the first to fall prey to economic crises and the majority of our fellow citizens who are victims of social exclusion and poverty are women .
in our opinion we also support dialogue and cooperation with civil society , especially women &apos; s organisations in countries preparing to join the European family , because here too we must anticipate uniform development which follows in the footsteps and adopts the rationale of the rest of Europe .
before I give Mrs Péry the floor , on behalf of the Council , I have a few comments to make .
this is Mrs Péry &apos; s third visit in succession to Parliament , and we welcome this .
that was the first point I wanted to make .
the only explanation I have for this is that the culprit is always drawn back to the scene of the crime .
Mrs Péry was Vice-President for some years , sat in this very chair , and we were always in a very safe pair of hands during difficult votes .
all the more reason why I am delighted to see you here today , Mrs Péry .
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteurs , ladies and gentlemen of the House , let me firstly thank you , Mr President , for this personalised introduction .
I am very pleased to be able to join you today for this important debate on the social agenda .
I must also say , however , that Elisabeth Guigou , the current Minister for Employment and Social Affairs , would have liked to have been able to attend proceedings here today in this institution to which she too once belonged and of which she has fond memories , but her new duties require her to be in Paris today , and she has therefore asked me to present her apologies .
before going any further , I should like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker , and also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , and its chairman , on the report before us today , which testifies to the dynamism and great commitment of the European Parliament to the social agenda .
following the informal Employment and Social Policy Council on 8 July this year in Paris , the Presidency invited all the parties involved , the European Parliament , of course , the Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions , both sides of industry , NGOs , Council groups and committees , to submit their proposals .
the European Parliament resolution on the social agenda which you are just about to adopt is a very ambitious contribution to our joint exercise .
the French Presidency welcomes this text and undertakes to give it the utmost consideration in its work .
the informal Council meeting of 8 July , the September conference you hosted with the European Commission and Mr Briet &apos; s tour of European capitals have provided the basis for a number of comments .
let me first make some general remarks on the social agenda before covering the various individual areas , in a very succinct way , as befits my allotted speaking time .
I am happy to be able to say that all the parties involved in social policy declared themselves in favour of drawing up an agenda .
this is intended to give a higher profile to European social policy and to make it more effective , preparing the European Union for the great shared challenges ahead .
the agenda is , of course , in keeping with the Lisbon conclusions and the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights , to ensure its effective implementation .
the areas of action listed in the Commission communication were also subject to general agreement .
what debates there were did not involve the type of action to be undertaken but rather the method to be adopted in order to achieve the desired objectives .
I think we should adopt a pragmatic approach and overcome any misguidedly ideological rifts .
as you very rightly suggest in your resolution , thereby supporting the approach proposed by the European Commission , we shall continue to use the entire range of Community instruments available to us : social dialogue , legislation , coordination , convergence , information exchange and financing under Community funds and programmes .
it is up to us to determine , area by area and action by action , the instruments best suited to the desired objective .
I now come to my more specific comments , and firstly my comments on employment .
employment is our number one priority , even if the method of tackling the problem is in flux .
here , too , I noted unanimity on the need to continue and step up the Luxembourg process in the context of the objectives established at the European Council in Lisbon .
we are particularly committed to the objective of full employment .
it is a false line of reasoning to set quantity off against quality , and Lisbon clearly established a twofold objective : more jobs and better jobs .
it falls to us to define the key elements which characterise the quality of employment and then to be capable of measuring these .
you will understand , given my duties as a member of the French Government , that I was particularly pleased to note that , firstly , the equality of men and women and , secondly , lifelong training are two areas which receive very strong support .
the subject of lifelong training was unanimously adopted as a priority area .
moreover , the two sides of industry have undertaken to work on this subject .
we must encourage them to do so in order to ensure that initiatives by collective agreement are taken to promote lifelong training within the shortest possible time limits .
let me , at this point , remind you that there will be a European Seminar on this subject on 4 and 5 December in Biarritz , which I shall be chairing .
on the subject of the equality of men and women , many Member States stressed the need for a better coordination of work and family life , particular with regard to childcare .
this is indeed a key issue , both in order to increase employment rates and in order to make progress towards male-female equality .
to stay on this subject a moment , your resolution provides for many measures in favour of women and contains one general objective to include the concept of male-female equality in all the sectors covered by the agenda .
I support this method .
as you perhaps know , on 27 October , I am holding a ministerial symposium on this subject .
I already spoke at length on this subject at your plenary sitting on October 5 .
I shall not therefore remind you of the three areas that we shall be debating at this meeting .
you will shortly be discussing the fifth gender equality programme for 2001-2006 .
I should like to thank you most sincerely for responding to the Presidency &apos; s invitation by working very quickly and very successfully , enabling us to adopt this most important programme , which proposes both an integrated approach and specific actions , on time .
you can count on me to make every effort to complete the task successfully and to support the financial commitment of EUR 50 million .
finally , in order to step up the integrated approach to equality , the Presidency was in favour of implementing this concept in a number of meetings of the Council of Ministers .
this is something that will be done under the French Presidency .
the social agenda has many more objectives .
let me just mention the mobility of workers .
freedom of movement must be encouraged , while ensuring that career paths are safeguarded .
I should also like to briefly point out our fight against insecurity and insecure employment . this must be dealt with better .
both sides of industry pointed out the need for common definitions .
I am thinking in particular of non-standard work .
plainly , a number of Community Directives on European works councils , transfers and mass redundancies , for example , need to be updated .
I also noted a strong desire for definition of a genuine Community strategy on the working environment , particularly concerning health and safety .
existing directives must be simplified and adapted to technical progress , but practical proposals must also be made on emerging risks or dangerous jobs .
let me say something about social protection .
we all agree that we should pursue the strategy of cooperation in social protection , paying special attention , as we were urged at Lisbon , to the issue of pensioners .
at the Employment and Social Policy Council held on 17 October , a great deal of progress was made in the fight against exclusion by defining appropriate objectives for the fight against poverty and social exclusion , which will serve as a foundation for national action plans .
the agenda could also give an opinion on the follow up to be given to the 1992 recommendation on minimum resources .
within the next few weeks , the Presidency intends to draw up a general report on all these subjects , in the light of the contributions submitted to us .
we should be able to successfully complete a document intended for the Heads of State and Government by the time of the Employment Council on 28 November . this document should express some real ambitions for the next five years .
quite clearly , the European Parliament will have made a significant contribution , and I thank you for this .
Mr President , today we are debating social policy .
I would like to warmly thank Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Kratsa for the huge effort they have made in order to set down thoughts from within Parliament on paper .
I would like to make two observations in this regard .
firstly , we used to debate the social action programme , and an action programme implies that something is done .
we are now discussing the social agenda and this could mean that something is done , but not necessarily , and so this is one of the aspects which we need to continually bear in mind .
we are dealing with a Socialist-inspired Council , so chances are that there will be a lot of talk and little action .
I hope I will be proved wrong .
what matters is that something is put on the agenda and that something is done .
this is the aim of this report and we have tried to emphasise this in a number of amendments .
today we are discussing social policy , as the rapporteur pointed out earlier .
in our Group , we have always set great store by the social market economy as a basis for everything we do , also within the framework of the European Union .
fortunately , we have largely managed to bring about the common market .
we have also managed to bring about a few things in the social sphere , but not everything , and this was because the Treaty of Amsterdam had not taken effect at the time ; so , in this light , the social action programme or this social agenda is of particular significance .
we need to try to list and identify the gaps left in the system , and at least put them on the agenda .
the importance of drafting an agenda is that we can include items which we hope the Commission will develop further .
a number of such points are included .
it would have been very wrong on the part of this Parliament not to make any mention of these points , but I am aware that we have not yet solved all the problems related to these points .
it is thus something which we are passing on to the Commission for further examination .
I would now like to turn to the point of open coordination which I believe is crucial . in fact , I would also like to refer to the recommendation made by Mr Cocilovo , which admittedly is not being discussed here but which will be voted on later .
in particular , his recommendation responds to Parliament &apos; s observations on employment .
this is why little mention is made of this in the present report .
however , these two recommendations should actually be seen as one entity for the picture to be complete .
I think there are some problems left unsolved , but these will need to be addressed in the course of the votes on the amendments .
I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker on producing an excellent report .
I have heard from some quarters that having read the report , they agree with the diagnosis but not with the prescription .
I take the view that unless we follow this prescription then the prognosis is not good for the stated aim of the social agenda , which is to make sure that social policy has a full and equal place alongside employment and economic policy .
this is the prescription we need to follow .
for the Socialist Group there are many very important points in this report .
for us the open coordination method is very important .
we want to see it strengthened in relation to employment .
we want to see it also applied to social exclusion and social protection .
I am glad to hear what Nicole Perry had to say to us today in that respect .
open coordination seems to be regarded by many as a soft option and I have no doubt that is why it is being supported in certain quarters .
it cannot be a soft option .
we will insist at every possible opportunity that it has to entail indicators and benchmarks and proper peer-group review and that there should be a part for Parliament in that procedure .
we also support social dialogue but we insist that the Commission should manage that procedure properly and that where negotiations fail we should have an expeditious introduction of legislation where necessary .
paragraph 14 lists a number of points we think are important .
I cannot go into them all in the time available but let me stress for us the importance of those paragraphs relating to the need to update the framework of legislation relating to restructuring .
again I was pleased to hear what Nicole Perry has said today .
I have not heard similarly encouraging things so far from the Commission in relation to , for example , the need to update the European Works Council Directive , or relating to collective redundancies and transfers .
we also , of course , place considerable emphasis upon the general framework relating to information and consultation to make sure that industrial change is managed with social responsibility .
Mr President , as far as the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is concerned , it is crucial that the Europe of the future should also be a social Europe .
the political task is therefore to find the best way of achieving that objective .
for us in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , it is important that decisions should be taken as close to the people as possible . this applies especially to labour market and social policy .
at the Lisbon Summit this spring , the EU &apos; s Heads of Government adopted a far-sighted vision for the development of a social Europe . importance was attached to promoting the EU &apos; s position in the knowledge society , as it was to open coordination in pursuit of common objectives , but with flexibility and freedom in the choice of resources .
this was established as a leading principle .
in its communication , the Commission has found a framework for the social agenda which I think admirably reflects the spirit of the Lisbon Summit .
in our view , open coordination is the correct route to go down if we are to secure a social Europe .
there may be a need for legislation in some areas , but we have no need for a host of bureaucratic and constricting rules which bring European cooperation into discredit without producing real results .
I also want to express my appreciation of the major effort which Mrs Van Lancker has put into drawing up the report .
her contribution has been very constructive , and if my Group is sceptical about a number of the main elements in her report , that is because we disagree politically , and that is , of course , understandable .
we do not therefore share the report &apos; s predilection for legislation at EU level .
there are a number of areas in which we feel that too much detail is gone into .
I want to emphasise that , in the EU countries , we have different traditions and different problems in the areas of the labour market and social policy , and the decisions of the Lisbon Summit acknowledge this .
the Commission &apos; s proposal strikes a good balance .
technological development and new methods of organisation call , of course , for flexible cooperation in which we concentrate more on objectives and on achieving results and less upon rigid regulation .
open coordination of this kind is not necessarily devoid of obligation .
of course , it must be binding , but it must be constructed from the bottom up and not developed by us specifying a host of rules and quotas centrally .
specifically , open coordination must be open both in the choice of resources and in the way in which everyone concerned is involved .
it is therefore important that more public interest be created for open coordination and that the latter should be focused on to a greater degree , whether it be in employment policy or with regard to the issue of social exclusion which we are now addressing and to which open coordination can also be applied .
it should not be secretive .
the process should be much better known , and it is here that I think Parliament has something to offer .
it can make the process more transparent and give it more public focus .
Mr President , first of all , I should like , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , to thank Anne Van Lancker and congratulate her on the quality of her report both in terms of its content and the inclusive way she strove to work on it .
the apparently technical term &apos; social agenda &apos; in fact covers the day-to-day realities experienced by our fellow citizens .
we must both respond to the urgent situation and give practical shape to what has been called the notorious European &apos; social model &apos; .
we have no right to miss this deadline unless we intend to shatter the expectations of all the citizens and the collective movements they have formed , which are the groups most motivated to establish a European Union which is a community of citizens .
the issues to be discussed select themselves : we simply need to respond to the urgency of the situation and bring in legislation to match the declarations made at the Lisbon Summit .
we must give the people of Europe the tools and the public policies they need in order to fashion their own place within Europe , in order to ensure that their fundamental rights , including social rights , are safeguarded .
the urgency of the social situation and the need to defend the European social model call for initiatives that aim to establish rights : the right to an income , the right to a wage , the right to decent pensions for all within the European Union .
implementing the ambitions for society declared in Lisbon calls for an effort on the part of the Community , an action plan to create jobs in services , especially those related to the information society .
as far as that is concerned , the directive proposed in the report in order to guarantee the social protection of new forms of working is essential .
it is also important to ensure quality in health , an improved social situation , and an improved environment for everyone - the third system - and tax and legislative measures are essential in order to ensure both the economic longevity and the visibility of this emerging economy of solidarity .
we support Anne Van Lancker and Mrs Péry when they propose to quickly adopt the 1998 directive on employee information and consultation and to revise the European Works Council Directive .
the fundamental notion of the general interest ought , moreover , to spur us all to approve the proposal to include recitals relating to employment in the regulations and decisions on the mergers currently dictated by considerations of competitiveness .
these three examples intended to combat poverty , support the development of activities for job creation , social liaison and quality of life , and to improve employees &apos; rights , should harness the support of a Parliament that is anxious to propagate the dream of a Europe of the Citizens , although these same citizens currently all too often feel that Europe is a machine commercialising all human activity .
a number of amendments betray the terror of some of our fellow Members who get their erasers out as soon as they see the word &apos; legislation &apos; .
are they going to go and explain to the people of Europe that Parliament deems it necessary to vote through directives to protect investment and liberalise general interest services , but not to define and regulate what has been described here as the labour market ?
such a rejection of legislation , moreover , leads to a plain rejection of negotiation . we even have one amendment that goes as far as proposing to eliminate the objective of concluding European collective agreements between the two sides of industry .
it is in this area that we can , in our opinion , find the kind of old-fashioned ideas attributed to those who expect a brave new world to spring out of a free market .
Mr President , there really is a need for a social agenda in Europe after many years of neo-liberal economic policy which has lead to unemployment and social exclusion everywhere , including in my own affluent country , Sweden .
begging has returned to our large towns after having disappeared from them as long ago as the immediate post-war years .
even the private charitable organisations and their soup kitchens appear to be needed again .
I must therefore welcome the purpose of the Commission &apos; s work and of Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report .
many of her proposals are extremely commendable and deserve our full support .
genuine social initiatives cost a lot of money , a factor which I think is discussed far too little in the report .
these resources must come mainly from the Member States . it is therefore the social authorities in each country upon whom demands must essentially be made .
governments must set aside more resources , more social workers must be appointed and more resources must be given to the voluntary social organisations . otherwise , the result will be fine words without any practical content .
Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report presents the Commission and its legislation as the real engine of social work .
I believe that the impetus must come from below and that it is a question of providing aid at a problem level .
the Commission can obviously make an important contribution , but the social problems have their roots in local conditions and must be handled with great sensitivity for the practical conditions concerned .
the Commission can help set a high standard , but it is social workers , the unions and voluntary activists we must pin our hopes on , and not officials in Brussels .
finally , I would just add that I am not a co-author of Amendment No 35 as stated in the document with the amendments .
on the contrary , I am very critical of the amendment .
the name Figueiredo should be there instead of my own name .
the Secretariat must have made a mistake , and I would ask for this to be corrected .
Mr President , I welcome the publication this year of the new European Union social policy agenda for the years 2000-2005 .
this received fresh impetus at the Lisbon European Council meeting of the European Union leaders earlier this year .
key priorities in this agenda include the following : an increased role will be given to the social partners in terms of drafting EU directives and regulations .
employee relations will be improved .
there will be continued European Union support for local job creation programmes .
new EU mechanisms for mediation , arbitration and conciliation will be drafted .
a new EU charter for small businesses will be put in place .
there will be improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the information society .
and there will be a modernising of telecommunications services and Internet-related activities .
from an Irish perspective I would like to say to the Members of the House that one of the reasons why there has been such strong economic progress in our country is the fact that we have had a system of social partnership in place since 1987 .
this has meant that the government has worked closely with the trade unions and employee groups on a whole range of economic and social activities in an effort to secure broad agreement in matters such as pay and conditions for employees in Ireland .
this has certainly helped to reduce industrial unrest in our country and has contributed to increased inward investment programmes from abroad .
I would also welcome the commitment of this policy agenda to the modernisation of telecommunications services .
the European Union must take advantage of the new and evolving technologies which are coming on stream at this time .
I welcome the publication of the new framework programme of telecommunications regulations and directives which was published in July of this year by the Commission .
Parliament is presently deliberating on seven different telecommunications regulations and is due to give an opinion on these matters before Christmas .
as regards e-commerce , it is fair to say that the United States of America had a head start on the European Union .
however , the European Union is catching up fast and the implementation of a broad range of telecommunications directives and regulations would certainly assist in this process .
finally , I would like to commend the Commissioner for consumer protection , Mr Byrne , for his efforts in trying to secure an agreement on how best to move forward on regulating a vast structure for e-commerce transactions now and for the future .
Mr President , for almost half a century European integration has been based on the economy .
indeed we spoke of a European Economic Community .
the priority was given to setting up a common market , with the principle of the free movement of property , goods and capital , the establishment of rules governing competition between firms and state aid .
social policy served to mitigate the most damaging effects of economic policies .
the provisions enshrined in the Treaty of Rome were confined to the principle of equal pay for men and women ( Article 141 ) and the freedom of movement of workers .
the Commission communication and Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report have the merit of remedying this imbalance by acknowledging the interaction between social and economic policy and employment policy .
Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report is an ambitious one . the rapporteur effectively asks the Commission to intensify the agenda , chiefly in the following areas : employment , with the framing of a European pact for employment and social cohesion , as concerns lifelong training and the introduction of prior cross-border testing of social and fiscal legislation .
next , in the area of social dialogue , this intensification would be expressed by adopting a directive on employee information and consultation , and the European Works Council Directive , with a revision of the directives on redundancies .
finally , in the area of social protection , it would take the form of pursuing a strategy of convergence .
it is a veritable catalogue of measures which is more a declaration of intent than a plan that could be implemented in the medium term .
in conclusion , the objective of giving new impetus to European social policy in the face of globalisation , enlargement and an ageing population is a laudable one .
it demonstrates that economic competitiveness and social cohesion are not mutually exclusive .
the method used , on the other hand , seems more debatable .
regarding the financing of NGOs and their participation in Community policies , there is still no legal basis in the Treaty , paragraph 13 .
similarly , with the new social agenda , there is a desire to pass legislation at Community level , at the risk of harmonising to minimum standards and short-circuiting social relations within the Member States .
before we continue with the agenda , there is something I would like to say .
due to the fact that we have wasted another 40 minutes today on a debate about the Rules of Procedure , we are now hopelessly behind schedule .
I must therefore ask you to stick religiously to your speaking time , so as to ensure that the sitting now proceeds in an orderly manner .
can you please discuss within your respective groups whether it is constructive to have forty minutes of moaning and groaning at the beginning of every sitting , before getting down to business .
the only people that suffer are you , who want to engage in political debate .
Mr President , if the rapporteur will allow me I will start by saying where I agree with her and - if the rapporteur will forgive me - that may not take long .
of course , colleagues and I share her ideals for a better standard of living for all the peoples of Europe , for a better quality of life and for promotion of social inclusion .
where I part company is on her proposals or - as Stephen Hughes said - her prescriptions to secure that end , because her proposals will lead us further away from those ideals rather than towards achievement .
various speakers have talked about the Lisbon Summit today . that was hailed six months ago as a very important summit .
mention was made there of a new direction for Europe : moving away from the social regulation agenda of the 1980s towards enterprise , innovation , competition and employment .
however , the report says something slightly different : whereas Lisbon calls for a reform of the social model , it calls for reinforcement ; whereas Lisbon calls for liberation of enterprise and more flexibility , the report proposes four new or amended directives and a number of legislative initiatives .
the report sets out the standard Socialist solution throughout the ages of legislation , legislation , legislation .
what we need to pursue our common goals is not more regulation , but less .
we do not want more burdening of business , we want less .
we do not want more unemployment , we want less .
the original Commission proposal was much better left unamended - congratulations Commissioner .
I propose that we leave it unamended and we reject the report , otherwise we will give the clearest possible signal that Parliament is continuing to pursue the old agenda .
surely it is time to move on .
Mr President , the Commission has tabled a very ambitious proposal , and I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for combining great understanding of national differences with considerable determination , without which this would never have been anything other than a pretty piece of paper .
I should also like to thank the other Anna for the substantial work she has done on this matter , something we could not have done without .
the debate today and in the Committee shows that there are major political differences and major differences in ambition in this area , and I think it good that these differences should be clearly brought out .
in this way , people have a clear choice when they vote at the next parliamentary election : a choice between those who want to see a social Europe and those who merely want the EU to regulate the internal market . a choice between right and left .
our fellow MEPs from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party and , in particular , from the British Conservative Party , have re-tabled a series of amendments which would genuinely weaken the ambitions of this social action programme .
every time legislation is proposed , these Thatcher-inspired neo-liberals embark upon an ideological crusade .
Europe does not deserve dogmatism , however .
what Europe needs is for us to assess pragmatically what regulatory tool will be the most effective in the practical situation .
in some cases , we need the open coordination method .
on other occasions , it is better for the two sides of industry to negotiate their way towards an agreement .
we must not , however , be afraid to use legislation if this is what is required for us to achieve our objectives .
I also want to raise another practical issue which this strategy has focused upon .
this is the need to come up with a definite strategy for the working environment which would give us the opportunity to devise a coherent policy in this area .
within the area of the working environment , too , we must make a practical assessment of which tools are best for solving the various problems .
here , too , dogmatism is not the way forward but , rather , finding pragmatic solutions to real problems .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I feel that the Lisbon Summit has presented us with a picture of a future Europe which cannot , which must not be purely an economic Europe , but which must be a genuine political entity .
and in order to be a political entity , Europe must have a cultural and social , as well as economic structure .
in my opinion , therefore , the proposal presented by the Commission on the social agenda is extremely positive .
however , I do agree with almost all of Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report - and for this I am grateful to her - for I do not believe that when Mrs Van Lancker makes a specific reference to clear objectives , proposals for specific instruments and , in particular , precise deadlines , that she is reverting to the socialist logic of old , as somebody has suggested today .
it is rather that she is simply reverting to a longstanding need , the need for cohesion in a situation which , from this point of view , is becoming increasingly difficult to regulate because it lacks any form of harmonisation .
in discussing a Charter of Fundamental Rights and advocating a European Constitution we cannot shy away from certain issues : we have to insist that all the necessary measures must be taken , even if this means producing more accurate legislation .
I do not believe that Mrs Van Lancker intends to create laws to regulate absolutely everything ; I feel rather that she considers it necessary , when coordinating actions do not produce the desired results , when the citizens encounter inequalities between the States and when there is no social harmonisation , to bring about this harmonisation .
the issue of open coordination must therefore be tackled alongside a comprehensive action to develop social legal bases , for without them we will not be able to persuade the States to harmonise a social policy which upholds equality and equal opportunities .
Mr President , now that we have had a return to growth , it is crucial for the European Union to provide itself with the means to meet expectations in the social sector .
the Commission communication highlights a raft of ambitious objectives , such as full employment , equal opportunities , training , etc . , but there are many contradictions between the European Union &apos; s declared ambitions and its political decisions .
among other aspects , let me cite the concern for productivity , which generally involves wage moderation as a priority .
I would therefore like to join my fellow Members in congratulating Anne Van Lancker on her report , which opens up new perspectives , with an approach which aims for greater precision and greater coherence .
her report appreciably builds on the Commission &apos; s proposals by suggesting the harmonisation of social regulations and the coordination of national social legislation .
it calls for a genuine European agreement to be framed in favour of employment and social cohesion and proposes initiatives on the gradual reduction of working time prior to retirement , the introduction of a minimum wage and cross-border supervision in relation to social and fiscal law .
this is all a specific encouragement to go beyond laudable intentions and actually take practical action .
this , I feel , is part of the consistent approach which we are lacking .
I am pleased to see , furthermore , that Mrs Van Lancker has included a number of amendments tabled by my Group , particularly that on factoring in the social dimension of enlargement and incorporating the right to strike into Community legislation .
together with my Group , I have tabled some amendments criticising the Commission &apos; s approach calling for the adoption of wage restraint .
I advocate the reduction of working times without a concomitant reduction in salaries .
having said that , I support Anne Van Lancker &apos; s report , which has the great merit of adopting an ambitious social policy backed up by specific objectives which go beyond the usual purely formal declarations .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker , who has supplemented the Commission &apos;s already excellent report with amendments tabled by myself .
naturally , I am very pleased about this : it is just a pity that the amendments which are most important in my opinion have not been included .
I listened with pleasure to Mrs Péry &apos; s brief summary of the Council &apos; s social policy , which I firmly support .
I am very familiar with the project and support all the work carried out by Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou to date . she will remember that I asked her , one day , whether her attitude to pensioners &apos; issues was that of a fairy godmother or a wicked stepmother .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are two people here today who deserve special congratulations , one being Anna Lancker , for her outstanding report , and the other being Anna Diamantopoulou , for her outstanding submission .
it is an ambitious agenda , and I still have a clear recollection of the painfully slow progress that was made during the last legislative period in the sphere of social protection .
the Council was not even prepared to discuss the matter at the time .
what is clearly new is that we have adopted an employment policy , based on the Lisbon Decisions , indeed an employment policy that should be of a qualitative nature .
we do not want over-regulation - and I say this to the British delegate who spoke before - but the diversity of modern contracts of employment requires new forms of social protection , and not the rules of the nineteenth century .
we also stand to gain a great deal from having a constructive and effective policy mix between economic and financial policy , and , not least , from developing the social economy and the services sector .
what is not so new , and the subject of repeated demands , is lifelong learning - which is something even the smallest Member States have done something about - as are the long overdue reforms to the European factory committee law , the legal protection of nursing and expectant mothers , and freedom of movement .
I would like to raise a criticism in connection with the lack of initiatives produced in response to the new challenges we face in health and safety at work , employee participation and labour relations .
of course , I was delighted to see the French Presidency show such commitment to the issues of childcare , family and women &apos; s policy .
perhaps it has something to do with the fact that all three people responsible - in the Commission , Parliament and the Council - are women .
but what we need now , in tandem with this , are instruments that allow for the involvement of fathers .
that would be a new departure .
besides , this agenda should send out a signal to the candidate countries , and I therefore wish it every success .
the Council must not leave various specific proposals that have been postponed year after year simply hanging in the air .
as the rapporteur , Mrs Van Lancker , emphasises , although social dialogue is important , it must produce tangible results .
otherwise , the Commission will have to propose legislative instruments and the Council will have to approve the measures needed , specifically by amending macroeconomic policies and the Stability Pact , in order to give credibility to our fight against poverty and social exclusion and to our efforts to defend good quality jobs with respectable salaries and to advocate reforms that give employees dignity .
Mr President , I think that the social policy agenda is positive for everyone .
I think that harmonising the social policies of the different Member States cannot do anything other than benefit all Europeans . it will be particularly beneficial in all aspects relating to employment , which , since the Lisbon Summit , we know is a priority for the whole of the European Union .
I would like to particularly stress the benefit which , in terms of employment , can be obtained by women through giving them improved access to employment with guarantees in terms of working time and salary .
I think that there is also a great advantage , if we succeed in getting the directive applied , modified and updated , with regard to maternity leave : for women to receive help during maternity and for maternity to be protected when women have to continue working during that period .
I also think that it will be very positive in terms of helping women to reconcile family and working life .
it is going to enable women to continue in their jobs without neglecting their family obligations .
neither can we forget what the e-Europe initiative means for new jobs , new technologies and the information society , where I think women have an important role to play .
these are new jobs where people can work from home with regulations that help to reconcile working life with family life .
all these coordinated social policy actions will also help to combat poverty and social exclusion .
I think that we should all welcome the arrival of this social policy agenda .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , the Commissioner and Mrs Péry on this presentation of the social agenda .
I consider the social policy agenda to be an extremely important political document which identifies instruments , sectors of intervention and timeframes and guarantees positive , dynamic interaction between economic , social and employment policies .
these instruments are intended to adapt the European social model in line with the changing reality .
I fully support Mrs Van Lancker &apos;s report and I would like , in particular , to stress a point which has , moreover , already been raised by both the rapporteur and Mrs Péry in their speeches , and that is the need for all the instruments to be genuinely implemented at European level , and therefore for application of the open coordination method to go hand in hand with reinforcement of the legal dimension .
this is what happens in many countries .
in conclusion , I would like to give an example : last week , the Italian Parliament adopted a new law on welfare which was proposed by a Minister - a woman , like the three representatives of the three institutions . this is tantamount to a revolution , for the old law on welfare had been in force for over 100 years .
Mr President , the Commission draft on the socio-political agenda contains many positive concepts such as full employment , quality of work , social quality and modernisation of social protection .
but it lacks substance to some extent .
Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s outstanding report makes good the deficiencies of the Commission draft as regards content .
we support a pact for employment and social cohesion , a European action plan for employment with a view to boosting the social economy and local employment initiatives , social regulations for new forms of working such as tele-working and new forms of self-employment , the minimum wage , and guaranteed income .
the European Union has already stood idly by for far too long , watching poverty and social exclusion take hold in the Member States .
indeed Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s proposals for improving the information available to , and participation of , female employees , and for social clauses in public contracts , mergers and international agreements , are long overdue .
we object to the fact that the Commission and the Council are unwilling to make additional resources available for the social agenda .
social quality cannot be achieved free and gratis .
it sometimes seems to me that the concept of modernisation is often tantamount to the undermining of social protection .
extending people &apos; s working lives is not modernisation , no more so is funding pensions by freezing or lowering the statutory pensions level , and advising people to take up investment opportunities on the financial markets .
we need modern , European social harmonisation , not deregulation .
Mr President , I have one minute and three points to make . firstly , I should like to thank Mrs van Lancker on the work she has done in producing this excellent report .
as for my second point , I wish to restate my Group &apos; s fundamental convictions .
the working areas opened up in the social agenda must be given a coherent , and certainly conciliatory , legal framework : the policy of convergence and the policies of coordination which have been initiated , and also supported by legislative measures , when necessary , which in turn should be reinforced by genuinely stringent monitoring methods .
as for my third point , there are some rights that have simply been glossed over from the viewpoint of a social Europe : the right to a minimum income , the information and consultation of employees , the European collective agreement .
these are points which , we know , are contested by the conservatives in Europe , but to which we , in our Group , attach great importance .
Minister , Commissioner , we must continue to adopt an ambitious approach on these issues .
I hope , Minister , that in Nice the French Presidency will succeed in pushing through an ambitious social agenda , since embarking on the construction of a social Europe is still the great hope of all our fellow citizens .
Mr President , I should like to extend my special thanks both to the rapporteur , Mrs Van Lancker , and the French Presidency for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed to date .
I shall try very briefly to pinpoint a few political aspects of the four areas touched on in greater or lesser detail by all the speakers , i.e. the new political approach in the social agenda , secondly the content , thirdly the means and fourthly the procedures .
as far as the political approach is concerned , we need , I think , to highlight two new elements .
the first is that , since Lisbon , the new approach to social policy is to deal with it not as a product or by-product of economic policy , but as a policy in its own right which needs to be exercised in tandem with economic policy and the employment strategy .
in other words , this is the only way for us to deal with Europe &apos; s objectives of competitiveness , given our constant concern for enterprises and the economy , and social cohesion , given our constant concern for our citizens and their welfare .
the second element in the new approach is quality . quality as a new political concept to deal with working conditions , employment relations and the services of the social state .
these two political approaches underpin the entire content .
what are the basic strands which make up the content ?
there are three .
a set of projects and proposals on employment .
the second strand to the social agenda is a set of projects on social policy .
here I would like to refer to the proposal for combating poverty and exclusion , the new work which we have started on pensions and social protection , policies for people with special needs and , more importantly , I would like to pinpoint a particular political aspect , i.e. the need for a new approach to social policy .
we must not simply calculate the cost of social policy , which is often seen from several political angles as an obstacle to economic development ; we must calculate the cost of not implementing social policy .
I think that this analysis will give us new , interesting results and approaches .
the third strand in the content is enlargement .
to be brief , social policy , the new social standards and harmonisation of the social legislation of candidate countries with the Member States are one of the most important features of the enlargement procedure and we must not lose sight of that .
this brings me to the third area which has engaged our attention today and throughout our cooperation : the means .
I think that the discussion on deregulation and legislation , i.e. do we or do we not need legislation , is old hat .
clearly we have a fairly complete legislative system in Europe , but changes on the job market , changes in the economy , changes in the environment due to globalisation and the information society are throwing up new requirements .
when we need to deal with these new requirements with legislation , we shall not , of course , have any hesitation in doing so .
if we can deal with them in other ways and with other methods , we shall do so .
the proposal for a scoreboard , for a specific method for monitoring the social agenda , is a huge challenge .
the problem is that , because of the legal basis which it has in the Treaty , the social agenda does not constitute a set of laws , a set of directives with specific steps for the Member States .
it is still hard for us to define European objectives which are equally valid for all the Member States because the situation on the ground varies .
we therefore believe that , in the first instance , common European indicators , a project which is now nearing completion , and national objectives , i.e. the need for each country to have its own scoreboard and carry out monitoring , are a step along the road to providing us with specific results .
and one last comment : the question of sexual equality runs right through the social agenda as regards both the political approach and the content and means .
thank you , Commissioner , for your interesting speech .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m .
Community framework strategy on gender equality ( 2001-2005 )
the next item is the report ( A5-0294 / 2000 ) tabled by Mrs Eriksson , on behalf of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , on the proposal for a Council Decision on the Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality ( 2001-2005 ) &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 335 - C5-0386 / 2000 - 2000 / 0143 ( CNS ) &#93; .
Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased to see you all here .
the Commission &apos; s communication affirms that democracy is a fundamental value of the EU Member States , the EEA States and the candidate countries , as well as a key part of external relations and development cooperation in the Union .
it also affirms that real democracy requires all citizens , women and men alike , to participate and be represented equally in the economy , decision making and social , cultural and civil life .
there are major deficiencies in all these areas . the Commission therefore proposes to tackle the problem with a combination of measures .
in tandem with integrating equality perspectives into all policy areas - what is normally called gender mainstreaming - specific measures for women will be implemented .
I fully endorse that strategy and approach and consider that it is not an exaggeration to say that no efforts to promote gender equality are of lasting value unless women &apos; s rights are strengthened at the same time .
this work has gone quite quickly despite the fact that it took a little time at the beginning .
the Committee has submitted 49 amendments .
at the beginning we had 126 , which indicates that we are incredibly committed .
I am very pleased about this .
we believe , for example , that it is very important for the Commission to guarantee maximum openness around this programme so that all interested parties can keep abreast of proceedings throughout the implementation phase .
it is also incredibly important , not to say fundamental , that the various Community actions , the framework strategy and the Member States &apos; measures complement , and do not counteract , each other .
this is , of course , also the Commission &apos; s and the Council &apos; s express ambition .
the Commission has now identified five focus areas of strategic importance .
I have no objections in this respect , nor has the Committee .
we have come up with a new shock proposal , which is really a reiteration of what was stated in our opinion on the budget .
we believe that 40 per cent of the Structural Funds should be earmarked to focus on women &apos; s conditions and needs .
the Commission &apos; s proposed measures should be expanded to include reviews of individual access to medical and health care and to social security and pensions , an analysis of shortcomings in the organisation of work and perhaps also a study of the significance of a general reduction in working hours .
what we have just recently discussed here in this Chamber are , of course , the social issues , and I wish once again to emphasise the repeated observation that over 50 million EU citizens are , in fact , classified as poor and that a large majority of those are women .
this is , of course , something which needs not only to be observed but also to be combated , and with the help of vigorous measures .
we have had a lot of detailed discussion of various assessment procedures .
I shall not go into any more detail here . rather , I just wanted to mention it .
we have touched upon the idea that the plan must be to increase accessibility and also scope for active participation for non-governmental organisations .
discussions have been held as to how the candidate countries can be incorporated in the programme in a natural way .
we have also discussed what we must do in order not only to give a mention to women in the developing countries but also to be able to do something practical in this area .
during the final phase of the journey , I have been in very close contact with people in both the Commission and the Council .
we naturally want to include the strategy in the Council decision , too .
what we mean in the Committee by strategy is , of course , not the Commission &apos; s opening gambit , but that strategy beginning as from paragraph 2 ( &apos; The Strategy &apos; ) .
I am saying this so that no mysterious or technical procedures cause this to be misunderstood , for no less than seven different amendments in the same spirit have been tabled .
in other words , the Council too must adopt the Commission &apos; s strategy .
it is therefore important that non-governmental organisations should obtain influence in the course of implementation .
one amendment is to the effect that it should be possible to hold an annual debate here in Parliament , together with the Commission .
this perhaps affects only the Commission and Parliament , but I am very grateful indeed for the fact that you , Mrs Diamantopoulou and you , Mrs Péry are here , and I am very much looking forward to hearing your points of view on all the amendments .
Commissioner , we waited with a great deal of anticipation for the Commission &apos; s communication on the strategy which it intends to apply to gender equality over the next five years .
unfortunately , the time available to us in committee did not give us a chance to process either the communication or Mrs Eriksson &apos; s report although , having said that , we did make every possible effort to respond to the objectives set by the European Commission .
at the same time , we must stress the need for complementarity between the measures and main lines of approach in the areas of economic life , equal participation and representation , social rights , the civil society and the roles and stereotypes of the two sexes .
women will then feel close to Europe and Europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas which will be formulated as a result of their connections with this programme .
we think it is extremely important to promote a positive image of women and visibility of their work and importance .
we think that these projects will help women gain self-confidence in their role .
finally , we trust , as was said during the previous plenary when we debated older parliamentary reports , that we will have an evaluation procedure of substance and consistency .
Mr President , Commissioner , we have had the fourth framework programme , and today we are discussing the fifth .
the present reports by the Commission and Parliament show that despite the fact that there have been a number of successes over the past few years , the list of unfinished or unsatisfactory points is too long .
therefore it is still our goal for the next five years to consolidate the position of women in the policies of all Member States , both in terms of quality and content .
as far as the strategic goals are concerned , for example , in the sphere of &apos; women in working life &apos; , economic and employment policy issues cannot be dealt with separately from issues of social responsibility , social security , and a fair distribution of caring responsibilities .
problems to do with access to social security must be looked at on a case-by-case basis to this end .
furthermore , the Community must do more in the way of assessing the need for additional initiatives , including , where necessary , implementing legislation and equal opportunities , and fighting discrimination .
the European Parliament , the national parliaments and networks must therefore become more closely involved .
financial resources are indispensable , as is always the case when goals are to be achieved and there is a great deal of catching up to do .
this programme is therefore conditional on funds totalling EUR 50 million being made available for the period from 2001 to 2005 .
this means that we must step up our efforts to achieve a women &apos; s policy that crosses the institutional and political divide , and to enable the equal opportunities strategies called for to be implemented more effectively .
we must invest our energies in the realisation and implementation of the planned programmes , and this must go hand in hand with well-timed evaluations and coordination with other programmes .
we expect to receive an annual report from the President of the Commission , within the context of an annual debate in the European Parliament .
it is also necessary to establish a Council of Ministers both in order to deal with the content of the work , and with a view to winning recognition for women &apos; s policy .
making women &apos; s policy an adjunct to other political themes does not do the matter justice .
women &apos; s policy must also be a criteria used to assess whether the candidate countries are ready for accession .
the European Parliament could lead the way here by setting a better example .
I hope that the sixth framework programme will not need to be as comprehensive as the present one .
for this to be the case , women &apos; s policy will have to be taken more seriously over the next five years and not just included in all political , economic and social programmes , but actually implemented .
women &apos; s policy is not - as happens so often - to be incorporated into programmes for minorities .
at 52 % , women are not a minority group !
I would like to congratulate Mrs Eriksson on an excellent report and the Commission on an excellent strategy for gender equality .
it encompasses all those areas where action is needed and , if successfully coordinated , could make a real difference to women in all aspects of their everyday lives .
this could work if the framework strategy were an integral part of the programme , as an annex to it .
this would ensure the implementation of the programme and I therefore support the comments made by the rapporteur earlier on .
there has not been a shortage of good ideas or good plans to achieve equality in the past but their implementation has often failed .
this time the Commission is putting forward a new approach .
it is very welcome but it is only valuable if it can actually be made to work .
that means also reaching women in their own communities .
the involvement of local and regional authorities in this process is invaluable .
they are the largest employers across the Member States and the central providers of education , training and economic development and , as such , they are key players in achieving equality .
I hope due regard will be paid to them in the final programme .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , no one is disputing that we should strive for greater equity between men and women .
for too long , women &apos; s role has been despised .
in this respect , the Napoleonic Code , which was framed in France at the beginning of the 19th century and exported to every corner of Europe , must shoulder a large share of the blame .
women must once again be given a place that is in keeping with the vital importance of their vocation , and I am not entirely sure that Mrs Eriksson &apos; s report makes any contribution towards this .
all the same , the texts before us are not entirely lacking in quality .
so , Amendment No 2 , presented by my own committee , grants single fathers the same rights as single mothers . equality and fair treatment must work both ways , that is the ideal .
I am delighted , moreover , that improvements in childcare facilities are planned in order to better support the reconciliation of professional and family life .
this report does , however , give some cause for concern .
amendment No 18 , for example , which seeks to support action by candidate countries to combat discrimination must not afford any opportunity to foist on them social choices alien to their culture .
in this respect , in New York , very distinct differences between the European Union and Poland emerged .
by failing to respect Poland &apos; s social choices , the European Union would be taking a very peculiar , and very disturbing , view of pluralism .
furthermore , Amendment No 19 on establishing an audit of equal opportunities within the public budget is extremely debatable .
indeed , the way the concept of discrimination has been manipulated makes it , in many respects , an empty formula used by a whole collection of sorcerer &apos; s apprentices in order to achieve their ideological ends .
it is high time we broke with an ideological vision of woman &apos; s place in society .
in this area , as in many others , it is essential for public authorities to exercise true pluralism in selecting their associates .
it is not right for a handful of women , expert in making claims of society and living on intravenous injections of public monies , to monopolise the role of speaking on behalf of women .
in this respect , I cannot but endorse the decision by the Committee on Budgets to break the monopoly held for so long by the European Women &apos; s Lobby .
I should like to see this House confirming this bold change of course .
a decision of this type would be like a breath of fresh air to the strange alliances which too closely bind a number of pressure groups to the European Commission and to some political groups in this House .
the women &apos; s movement can only be strengthened by such a decision .
I could go even further , and say it would be ennobled by such a decision .
this is something my Group will take into consideration in its final vote .
( applause from the UEN Group )
Mr President , we are aware of the progress that has been made in recent years with regard to the situation of women , particularly the legislative progress , but there are still situations of real inequality in everyday life .
the low level of representation of women in political and economic spheres and gender-related violence are two clear signs that structural discrimination against women is continuing .
this programme will undoubtedly help to ensure that the concerns , needs and aspirations of women are taken into account in all policies .
the current situation requires that positive action measures in favour of women be implemented .
the objectives that the programme sets out in five specific areas will help to ensure that all the action taken will be associated with at least one of those areas .
participation in economic life , which women should enjoy under equal conditions to men , employment , which is the basis for all equality and integration , and achieving the 60 % target proposed at the Lisbon Summit , would also solve other problems .
the inclusion of this objective in all Community programmes , within the framework of the Structural Funds , should be effected in accordance with Community legislation .
equality in participation and representation , balance in the decision-making process , greater participation in political life , whatever the process adopted , in order to achieve an increase in the participation of women , until we reach the 40 % figure proposed by the Commission .
equal access and full enjoyment of social rights for women and men , which would mean ensuring that the legislation is applied in the social sphere in terms of maternity leave , maternity protection , working time , employment contracts , etc .
equality between women and men in civil life , allowing women to fully enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms .
we especially need to guard against and eradicate trafficking in women and domestic violence .
we need to encourage a change in the roles and stereotypes associated with gender , which will also help to solve some of the other problems above .
in relation to this objective we will support the organisation of awareness campaigns and a European equality week in cooperation with the Member States , as the Commission proposes .
we think that it is very useful to create a web site , not only due to the increasing use of computerised media , but because this will help women to familiarise themselves more and more with this new world from which they must not be excluded .
something that we think is of particular importance is the evaluation of the programme ...
( the President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe we are now discussing Commissioner Diamantopoulou &apos; s second tour de force .
with the framework strategy and the new action programme in place , the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities - working under intense time pressure , and restricted to only a few official languages - has now , with a great deal of good will , introduced 60 proposed amendments .
I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council , Nicole Péry , will be able to get through the programme in the Council in November .
I hope there will be no repeat of the fourth action programme , when the erstwhile Federal Government under Helmut Kohl halved the budget , no less .
time is pressing .
women are still not adequately represented in politics and in economic decision-making processes .
according to EUROSTAT , approximately 77 % of the recipients of low wages are women .
depending on the country and sector , women earn up to 30 % less than their male counterparts .
the framework strategy must be brought to bear in this regard as well .
all the equal opportunities initiatives should be coordinated under one roof and translated into the five , specific , strategic goals .
other speakers have made the same point .
that would be the logical way to implement the gender mainstreaming concept .
I am expecting the male protagonists to at last get down to work and do their bit to counter inherited notions of gender roles and stereotypes .
we also want to see the leading politicians on our side , and call upon President Prodi , the Council , and the Ministers , to take full account of the gender aspect , for example in the context of the European Union &apos; s foreign relations , and particularly where the enlargement process is concerned .
more emphasis should be placed on establishing links between women &apos; s organisations , which is something I called for back when I was rapporteur for the interim report on the fourth action programme .
our parliamentary committee plans to stage a conference on this specialist policy area , together with the parliamentary committees of our Member States and of the candidate countries , in November in Berlin .
I am hoping that this will provide the necessary political impetus for the implementation of the programme and framework strategy .
this is where Europe will again lead the way in the fight for women &apos; s rights in Europe .
Mr President , following the first four action programmes for equality between women and men , it was a good move on the part of the Commission to innovate by proposing a Community framework strategy for equality and a programme to implement this strategy and make real progress towards equality .
there is great need of this , even though a quarter of a century has passed since the first Community directive on the equal treatment of men and women with regard to pay .
I find the Commission &apos; s new approach to be a very positive one , and the proposal for a decision for the 2001-2005 programme to have been well considered .
unfortunately , the report by the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities is no improvement on the text put forward by the Commission .
it overeggs the pudding , and includes unconsidered and indigestible proposals , worded in such a way as to make a first-year law student &apos; s hair stand on end .
in committee , I had tabled a raft of amendments intended to do away with the worst of the incongruities , particularly those that demonstrated an outlandish mish-mash of strategy and programmes .
the Commission has produced an excellent text .
it is a very serious mistake , in politics , to mix strategy up with tactics or with programmes .
as is so often the case in reports by the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , we have here a report including the ideological claims of the left wing coalition , the gauche plurielle , in this Parliament , like the claim that measures eligible for programme funding in a transnational context should include the analysis and assessment of , I quote , &quot; the significance of a general reduction in working hours &quot; .
do we really need to waste any of the paltry EUR 53.45 million in appropriations to cover five years on such an analysis ?
I think not .
I am also of the opinion that the appropriations for the European Women &apos; s Lobby , budget line A 3037 , should not be included in the appropriations committed for the programme and I hope that the Commissioner will favour the amendments that I and the other members of my Group have tabled , above the rapporteur &apos; s own far-fetched amendments .
Mr President , I think it would be a great shame if Nicole Péry were not also to seize the opportunity to state her opinion now that she is here , so that we might hear her points of view , too .
Mrs Eriksson , Mrs Péry has not asked to speak and I cannot force her to . I cannot order the President-in-Office of the Council to take the floor .
in any case , I feel that we should thank her for following the debate , especially since she was not scheduled to be present during this discussion as well .
however , I see that she is preparing to leave now .
Mr President , I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Eriksson , who has endeavoured in the short time available to respond to the need for us to accept the programme as quickly as possible , so that we can avoid a vacuum between the fourth and fifth programmes and can start implementing the fifth programme in January .
this programme is an important document for the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights , which is why it provoked a great deal of interest and , of course , it forms part of the more overall strategy which was discussed with the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights , the Committee on Social Affairs and the Council .
it is the familiar 5-pronged strategy of participation of women in economic life , at the decision-making centres , in social policy , in civil society and in human rights , together with the new model of gender equality for the mass media and education .
our cooperation with the committee was excellent , which is why we can accept a large number of amendments , either to the letter or in spirit .
specifically , we accept Amendments Nos 2 , 4 , 5 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 23 , 28 , 32 , 43 , 46 , 48 , 49 , 51 , 55 , 56 and 59 .
we are also able to accept parts of Amendments Nos 3 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 20 , 27 , 35 , 37 , 45 , 50 , 53 , 57 and 58 .
I think that the large number of amendments accepted is illustrative of the meeting of minds between the Commission and the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights .
I should like to make two comments on the amendments which we are unable to accept , mainly for technical and legal reasons rather than because of a difference of approach .
first , as far as the strategy is concerned .
it is not possible for the entire strategy to form part of the Council decision , but I agree that some amendments could be made to the wording of the articles in order to make it perfectly clear that this strategy has been taken into account and forms the basis on which the programme will be implemented .
secondly , as far as the specific percentage to be earmarked from the Structural Funds is concerned .
I should remind you that a regulation was voted through last year which clearly sets out how items are allocated and we cannot use a programme to change the regulation which already exists .
I must stress that we absolutely agree on the need to focus on complementarity between current actions and programmes and , of course , on the important role which non-governmental organisations must play in designing and implementing these programmes .
major European women &apos; s organisations therefore clearly have access to all the programmes .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m .
competition policy
the next item is the joint debate on the two reports tabled on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy :
( A5-0290 / 2000 ) tabled by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen , on the XXIXth report on competition policy - 1999 &#91; SEC ( 2000 ) 720 - C5-0302 / 2000 - 2000 / 2153 ( COS ) &#93; ;
( A5-0281 / 2000 ) tabled by Mr Evans , on the Commission &apos;s eighth survey on State aid in the European Union &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 205 - C5-0430 / 2000 - 2000 / 2211 ( COS ) &#93; .
Mr President , I very much welcome the Commission &apos; s report .
it is a splendid piece of work that Commissioner Monti and his staff carried out last year .
in my report on the twenty-ninth report on the Commission &apos; s competition policy , I expended particular energy on the problems concerning mergers and the repayment of State aid .
I did this for a number of reasons .
firstly because , in the course of last year , I was approached on a number of occasions by companies which have felt a certain degree of powerlessness in connection with rulings on mergers , especially in relation to those cases in which they have needed to appeal to the Court of First Instance against the Commission &apos; s ruling .
with regard to State aid , moreover , problems apparently still exist with ensuring that unlawfully paid State aid is paid back to the national exchequers .
let us begin , however , with mergers . one consequence of EMU is , of course , that we see more and more mergers .
I also think the time is ripe for re-assessing whether the procedures and sets of rules we have at present are as good as they could be .
the world is not , of course , always so easy for those who have to follow the rules and procedures we are involved in devising .
I think it is necessary for clear rules to be devised for what is called the relevant market .
it is important to distinguish between what may be called the peripheral areas of Europe and what may be called the heart of Europe .
it is especially important to put this distinction in place before enlargement , for it can be difficult for the smaller countries in the peripheral areas when companies wish to merge , because the latter quickly become large players in their own market .
it is not especially appropriate that larger companies in small countries should be prevented from merging for , in that way , their opportunities to compete globally are reduced .
I should therefore like to remind you that we do , of course , have existing rules to take care of those circumstances in which companies exploit their important and possibly dominant market positions .
we therefore need not perhaps be so afraid of mergers .
after all , it is not a crime for companies to merge .
another thing I feel very strongly about is the need to arrange for mergers to go through more quickly .
I am thinking here , in particular , of those circumstances in which a company wishes to appeal against the Commission &apos; s ruling .
quite simply , a period of between 25 and 35 months is too long in our global village for getting a case through the courts , and what is very time consuming is having the documents of the case translated .
that is not good enough .
we owe it to our companies to offer them the best conditions so that they are able to plan their production and , especially , their future .
on the subject of mergers , I have two questions for you , Commissioner Monti .
would it be possible to consider different possible solutions for separating the Commission &apos; s functions of judge and prosecutor ?
for example , could there be a panel of independent experts during the second hearing so that it is not exclusively people from the Commission who assess individual merger cases ?
I also have another idea , even if it is perhaps a touch outside your sphere of authority .
might not a committee of experts or an expert tribunal , specialising in companies , be set up in the department of first instance at the court in Luxembourg ?
in Denmark , for example , we have a special maritime and commercial court dealing exclusively with issues relating to companies .
I would also take the opportunity of asking the Commissioner to explain why one of the most trusted merger specialists has left the Commission .
the other subject I raised in my report is that of State aid and the repayment of State aid which has been awarded unlawfully .
I make no secret of the fact that I feel very strongly about tightening up on the repayment of State aid which has been awarded unlawfully , especially since this is another area it is important to sort out before enlargement .
it is good that State aid to shipyards in Europe should be phased out as per 1 January 2001 , even if it is extremely problematic that our shipyards should continue to have to compete with the South Korean treasury .
in the light of the latest development , I can appreciate why the Commission has , with good reason , adopted a harder line on South Korea .
I am wondering , therefore , if you could report on the very latest developments , Commissioner , even though I am well aware that you only have limited time available .
I also want to take the opportunity to ask Commissioner Monti if and when a public , efficient and properly functioning register of State aid may be expected to be put in place and , in the same vein , when the long-promised scoreboard is to become a reality .
finally , I want to emphasise that , for me as a liberal , it is crucially important that companies can be sure of being dealt with properly and efficiently in all areas , so that there are no hitches where companies &apos; future legal certainty is concerned .
I should also like to thank my fellow MEPs in Committee for the splendid way in which they have cooperated in connection with my report .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her contribution and for her cooperation in relation to these two reports .
they have been taken in joint debate because common issues apply .
I endorse much of the agenda that has been set by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen .
I should like to begin somewhat unusually by congratulating the Commission on a document it published back in June 1999 - the Community rules on state aid , what I might call the &quot; idiot &apos;s guide &quot; to the operation of the state aid scheme .
it is helpful in that it sets out the Treaty provisions , the definitions of state aid and also the exemptions from the ban on state aid .
in the course of preparing my report , I have had to struggle with that particular conundrum .
there are those in this House who will wish to emphasise the exemptions ; however , I wish to make it clear that for the most part the operation of state aid works against free competition within a single market .
the single market is essential in terms of promoting the interests of consumers .
they must have a wide variety of high-quality , competitively priced goods and that , ultimately , is the reason for pushing forward with the single market and , along with it , free competition , because it is to the benefit of all our citizens .
turning now to the eighth survey : although there has been a reduction in the overall level of state aid during the period concerned , this can in fact be attributed to a minority of Member States and , taken overall , ten Member States have seen levels of state aid increase .
I know that is a matter of concern to the Commissioner and it is certainly a concern I share .
I therefore welcome the indications we have received from the Commissioner that he anticipates that by July of next year we will be seeing progress in relation to the delivery of a state aid scoreboard and register .
that is important in terms of the need for transparency .
I would ask him how he sees the debate on enlargement in view of the fact that , on the one hand , we must ensure that we have a common regime across all states within the European Union and , on the other hand , it must be the case that some of the candidate countries have particular difficulties in adjusting to new open market conditions .
I would also make the point to Commissioner Monti that it is important that in the next survey we see a rather larger section on the financial services sector .
I should like to congratulate him on a speech he made in Barcelona in September - and I am very grateful to his staff for sending a copy of the speech to me - devoted as it was to his view on the synergy between state aid control and the financial services sector .
but in due course we must see rather more of that in the state aid report itself .
I also would wish to see changes in the way that the state aid report is put together in order to ensure it is able to take account of future developments .
for instance , during the period of time of this report , no state aid was given to the coal sector in the UK and yet we all know that significant aid is currently being proposed by the UK Government .
I take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner for some information regarding two cases within the United Kingdom where the Commission has currently instituted action - if indeed it is the case that action has been instituted .
there are the cases of the universal bank proposed by the UK Government to assist post offices in the UK and also the venture capital schemes in the regions of the United Kingdom .
I understand he has asked for information concerning this .
it is quite clear that throughout the report itself much attention has been directed not just to the past but also to Commissioner Monti &apos; s proposals for future reform of competition policy .
that is an issue which will be coming before Parliament in due course .
Commissioner Monti will be very well aware of the concerns that are shared by many people who support his proposals for reform but feel that there need to be answers in relation to issues like jurisdiction shopping , legal certainty , the role of national courts , dialogue between the national competition authorities and the Commission itself , as also issues of staffing within the Commission .
those are matters that we will consider in debates in due course and for which - I am delighted to inform the Commission - I have been appointed Parliament &apos; s rapporteur .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in view of the lavish amount of speaking time we permit ourselves for debates of this kind , I want to dispense with the preliminaries and address Commissioner Monti directly .
Commissioner , you know that for some time now , there has been a substantial consensus in this House on competition issues . this means that the entire House supports the Commission in matters of competition policy .
with the passage of time though , I have begun to wonder whether the Commission is not , in fact , gradually losing its sense of perspective where individual decisions are concerned , or whether it even wants to prejudge fundamental decisions in entirely different political fields under the mantle of competition .
I will cite one of several examples , and it is one that is currently the subject of intense debate in other regions besides my own .
it concerns the subsidisation decision or non-subsidisation decision in relation to the coal industry .
I will take the precaution , Commissioner - in case you should want to point out that this in fact falls within Commissioner Palacio &apos; s remit - of saying that I am addressing the Commission as a whole .
I would also draw your attention to the fact that the coal issue is raised both in the competition report and in the subsidy report that we are discussing today .
I expect the Commission to uphold its agreements .
I do not expect it to abuse judgements from the Court of Justice in order to withdraw from these agreements .
I will reiterate what I have already said repeatedly in debates of this kind : competition is not an end in itself .
when a decision is to be taken in matters of competition policy , account must be taken of the social , structural and industrial implications , and if this is not done then competition policy will degenerate to the level of pure ideology .
if the aspects I mentioned are taken into consideration , and one considers the net product chain of the state-of-the-art technology , then the subsidy licences that have fallen due for coal mining must be granted without delay .
this does not just apply to the sphere of energy policy ; it applies right across the board .
competition is important but it is not the be-all and end-all .
to sum up , what we need is to strike a balance between competition rules and acting for the public good .
this must be the guiding principle in all areas .
Commissioner , I want to take up what I said at the beginning .
the support is still there .
but if you carry on in this vein , you risk losing the support of not insignificant sections of the House .
I dare say that is unlikely to help matters overall .
Mr President , I am going to talk about Mrs Riis-Jørgensen &apos; s report .
I want to begin by congratulating her on a very good report .
one of the absolutely basic principles of EU cooperation is that competition between different companies , products , countries and regions should work well and be fair and correct , as well as be for the benefit of consumers .
allow me to begin with something said by Adam Smith , the father of economic liberalism , in 1776 , to the effect that people in the same industry seldom meet for pleasure or diversion without their conversations &apos; ending with a conspiracy against the general public or some device for raising prices .
certainly , a good deal has happened in the last 200 years or so , but we have the same aspirations today .
if the internal market is to operate , we must have active institutions which look after issues of competition .
Commissioner Monti is to be congratulated in this respect .
paragraph 16 of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen &apos; s report talks of increased legal certainty where applications for mergers are concerned , together with more effective and shorter timeframes within which to appeal before courts .
this applies particularly in view of the fact that , in dealing with mergers , the Commission has something of a double role .
the Commission both supervises and applies the rules of competition .
this double role makes special demands in terms of openness , control and predictability .
the second paragraph I want to mention is paragraph 18 .
it is of general relevance , but its point of departure is the planned merger between motor manufacturers Volvo and Scania .
as is well known , the Commission opposed this merger , which in turn led to an extensive debate about how the rules of competition operate and how market shares are to be calculated and assessed .
a clearer definition and further discussion are needed in this area .
as long as the internal market is not complete , it is mainly large companies in small Member States which can lose out in competitiveness to companies elsewhere in the world .
how are large companies with large home markets to be able to merge and compete in a global market if the EU &apos; s rules make this impossible ?
coming as I do from a small country , I myself am very pleased , therefore , that the Committee should have adopted the amendments I proposed in this connection .
I hope that the Commission is now also prepared to broaden the discussion and shed more light on the rules of competition on the basis of these assumptions .
Commissioner Monti , on behalf of the Italian Radicals , I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the two sound reports they have produced , which commend both your work and the work of the Directorate-General for Competition .
I would like to take this opportunity to raise a few general points regarding European competition policies and also the competitiveness and opening-up of the European markets , not in order to deny any progress made thusfar , but with a view to the future .
in my opinion , a particularly regrettable factor , if we want a genuinely open and competitive market economy to develop , is still the presence of large numbers of powerful public companies in sectors which have already been formally liberalised or which are currently going through this process .
I could mention , for example ... let me see ... the State monopoly of retirement pensions , but I will restrict myself , more pertinently , to firms operating in the sectors of general interest services .
it is my view that , in these sectors , competition and the market are being severely hampered by the fact that the State is both regulator and operator .
I know , Commissioner , because I have had occasion to read and hear your views on the matter , that your response to the objections is that the articles of the Treaties do not provide for any distinction between the public or private nature of firms .
however , we cannot be satisfied with this response if we want Europe to become a more competitive and more open market in the future and - dare I say it - if we study carefully certain situations which are developing , in which even the current rules would allow us to intervene .
the whole of Europe is experiencing the growth of an aggressive State capitalism which has resulted in a series of private companies being taken over by State monopolies or former monopolies , in any case by companies which are firmly in public hands , companies which are state-owned .
we have heard the justification many times ; it is always ready to be trotted out - we must ensure that our companies and their assets retain their value through the privatisation process - meanwhile privatisation generally becomes more and more delayed instead of facilitated .
and , naturally , these are clearly statements to which the ears of the various Ministers for the Treasury in Europe are extremely sensitive .
in all cases , these are public companies whose financial prowess derives from their past and present positions of monopoly rather than managerial expertise .
in many cases , they are companies which operate entirely or in part with considerable legal monopolistic reserves .
truly , Commissioner , can we not perceive in these cases the existence of State aid , concealed to a greater or lesser extent , or abuse of a dominating position ?
or again , the transfer at the very least of the distorting effects of the dominating position from one sector to another ?
or , lastly , the ever increasing consolidation of the positions of the incumbents which will make it difficult for newcomers to enter the various markets after liberalisation ?
by way of example , Deutsche Post has recently gained control of DHL International and is operating under a monopoly for dispatches up to 200 grams , and then , on a more general note , we could cite the diversification of the State postal companies in other sectors ;
EDF ( Eléctricité de France ) has taken over companies in Britain , Sweden and Finland , France Telecom has taken over Orange ; on the Italian side of things , Enel has taken over Infostrada and , still in the Italian context , we could mention the various companies owned by local authorities which are behaving in a similar fashion .
lastly , Commissioner , there is the case of the public financing of State television under the alibi of financing a public service , which is a concept that is fading fast .
of course , there is the Treaty of Amsterdam , but I wonder whether the constraints imposed by the governments on the excellent work of your predecessor should , in any case , be justified as a way of exempting these companies from European competition rules .
Mr President , we welcome the modernisation of the competition policy which , in terms of set-up , has undergone little change since the sixties .
this overhaul is all the more imperative since nearly all of the Member States have now established a sound , independent competition authority .
I do not share the concern expressed by quite a few fellow MEPs with regard to the re-nationalisation of policy .
if we want to avoid a chaotic and unwieldy bureaucracy in Brussels , then we have no choice but to embrace decentralisation .
I am delighted about the special attention being paid to the position of large undertakings in small Member States in Paragraph 18 of the motion for a resolution .
these are the ones experiencing major adverse effects from infringements of the internal market or from the continued existence of borders within the internal market , because their &apos; home market &apos; cannot sufficiently absorb these blows .
what are the Commissioner &apos; s objections to lending the concept of &apos; relevant market &apos; a predominantly EU-wide dimension in the event of mergers ?
I would also like to draw the Commissioner &apos; s attention to the environmental significance of soil decontamination projects .
naturally , we endorse the polluter pays principle . but this principle certainly cannot always be applied , especially in the case of large or substantial soil decontamination projects , because we will then end up with contaminated soil well into the next century .
given the staff shortages in your Directorate-General , Mr Monti , it is not logical to accord a great deal of attention to this .
it seems to me that the effect of these projects on the competitive sphere is rather minor .
finally , the book by your predecessor , and former Commissioner , Mr Van Miert , entitled &quot; Mijn jaren in Europa &quot; &#91; My years in Europe &#93; gives some idea of the blackmail-like tactics which a Competition Commissioner comes up against .
it speaks volumes .
I hope you are affected by this to a lesser extent , but I fear the worst .
I therefore wish you all the strength and wisdom you will need to keep your chin up over the next couple of years , and I look forward to reading similar memoirs by yourself in due course .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to say a warm thank you for the reports we have heard about today , and which do not just record what happened in the past , but also pick out the central themes of the present debate , and even incorporate the Commission &apos; s plans .
competition is not , as has already been said , an end in itself .
it must serve the interests of consumers , companies and local conditions .
competition is therefore always a means to an end .
it is a vital cornerstone of our model , in terms of political order , of the socio-economic market economy .
I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything , which is why competition is not completely unrestricted , nor should it be .
we therefore need two things : firstly , in the interests of increased transparency , we need to make the public aware of all the approved subsidies that influence competition , and secondly there must be areas of our day-to-day lives and behaviour which are not subject lock , stock and barrel to the dictates of European competition policy .
the sports sphere or the numerous non-governmental organisations in the social and health spheres , to quote two examples .
who , like us , says &apos; yes &apos; to a functioning internal market , must also have the courage of their convictions to say &apos; yes &apos; to European competition policy .
therefore , we welcome the modernisation of competition policy , which is initiated and then maintained by a stream of new proposals .
the Community &apos; s competition policy has been given a new European and international dimension .
in view of the enlargement process and globalisation , it is playing an increasingly important part in economic relations within and outside the European Union .
I therefore welcome the modernisation going on within the Community on the one hand , and the fact that European competition policy now extends beyond Union borders .
on a final note , we need a more precise definition of the relevant market because , increasingly , the market is not the national market .
we need to promote the citizens &apos; awareness of competition policy , so that they recognise the advantages .
we also need to step up debate in the European public arena on the relevant proposals , because they are frequently misunderstood .
what I mean - and this is directed at the public , not the Commission - is that its decentralised application must not lead to renationalisation , but must instead lead to Europeanisation .
when you delegate responsibility , you must take care not to surrender your key responsibility !
lastly , boosting the citizens &apos; autonomy must not create legal uncertainty , rather , European competition policy must well and truly leave its mark on the thoughts and actions of the people beyond the institutions .
we still have a lot to do on that score , Commissioner !
Mr President , today no one disputes , and of course I am not going to do so , the fact that state aid alters the conditions for competition and is a damaging element that encourages inefficiency in undertakings .
this is certain , but if each and every one of us is honest , we have to admit that in our public life we have often defended state aid when an undertaking has required it in order to establish itself , for example , in our constituency , or in order to prevent it from closing .
I began by saying this in order to highlight what is associated with some positions and to point out that when we are trying to issue a European Parliament opinion on the annual report on state aid , the Group of the Europe People &apos; s Party tries to conduct an ideological debate in this House on state aid in which it aims to go further than anyone and to demonise all types of aid .
this happened last year with the Jonckheer report , and this year , despite the more flexible position adopted by Mr Evans , it has continued to arise , perhaps in order to present the Socialists as some sort of outdated interventionists who use measures that are as damaging for the market as state aid .
I have already had the opportunity to express that state aid is a transfer of public money to private companies and , therefore , that as Socialists we should also be against it .
however , we cannot deny the obvious and we should recall that the Treaty does not forbid all types of aid , so some types that are aimed at objectives such as social cohesion , regional cohesion , the environment , etc. should be permitted . if that is the case , and it is , why does the Group of the Europe People &apos; s Party refuse to accept amendments that cover that point ?
the same occurs when the report insists , following the Commission &apos; s line , that aid for coal did not serve to secure the future of the industry , but in the same paragraph they refuse to accept a sentence , also from the Commission , saying that this aid was necessary in order to mitigate the social and regional impact of the restructuring of the sector .
in this respect , it is difficult for us to agree with a report which , although it reflects part of the truth , refuses to include another part of the truth .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Evans and Mr Karas have highlighted the significance of state aids and competition policy very clearly in this debate .
in future we must remember that there are national aid schemes , in respect of internal competition , for example , which are especially important and valuable in countries with low population densities and where distances are long .
I wish to raise one issue in this regard , that of transport aid .
I am thinking here of my own country , for example , where the distances are long .
in the north the price of fuel is 0.2 euros higher than in southern Finland .
in addition , shipments of raw materials , animal feedingstuffs and similar goods are especially important as far as internal competition is concerned and issues of major importance in order that state aids may continue to support them .
they are especially significant with regard to the regional economy and employment , and I hope that in future this can be made clear , so that these aids , these internal aids , which affect regional development and the regional economy , in which transport aid is a key example , might continue .
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , ladies and gentlemen , a European , open , competitive and coordinated market economy needs an effective competition policy .
without a properly administered competition policy , neither the European Union &apos; s economy nor its external manifestation , in the form of the euro , will ever be able to achieve its full potential .
only a company that is competitive in the Internal Market without State aid can also be competitive in the global market .
however , in shaping European competition policy we have to ensure that it does not limit the opportunities for companies to succeed in the wider , global economy as well .
besides , a dominant market position is not even a problem unless there is evidence that this position is being abused .
only if the dominant market position leads to adversity with regard to consumers and competitors must we tackle the situation using stringent measures , as you , Mr Monti , have done .
as Mrs Riis-Jørgensen states in point 15 of her report , we have to focus on the harm caused as a result of measures restricting competition , and not so much on what sort of economic players are involved .
special account must be taken of the position of small and medium-sized enterprises .
small-scale State aid might be more harmful to an SME than people think if the market is a small one .
for that reason it is good that this report of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen &apos; s also emphasises the importance of this .
in his report , my colleague , Mr Evans , thanks you , Mr Monti , for having got to grips with the issue of State aid policy .
massive amounts of State aid are still a problem in many sectors .
although State aid may , on the surface , seem a good solution , when viewed in the longer term it very rarely produces lasting positive results .
I certainly do not want to condemn all State aid .
there is also aid that is necessary , as laid down the Treaties .
in the long run , however , levels of State aid will have to fall .
State aids lead to the postponement of inevitable structural change , to the distortion of competition , and breed inefficiency .
in a sense , State aids prop up Potemkin villages , which at some stage will come crashing down .
then it is the private consumer and the taxpayer who foot the bill .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all let me express my deep disagreement with the excessively liberal , if not actually ultraliberal , tendencies of the report by our fellow Member , Mr Evans .
hearing him deny the fact that state aid was reduced in the period 1994-1998 , even though the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction , is already bizarre , to say the least .
let me add that state aid must be supervised strictly according to the terms of the treaties and not in accordance with the prevailing liberal ideology .
between the omnipresent State , which no one wants any more , and the completely absent State , which is nothing more than a modern-day law of the jungle , this concept which many term the European social model forces us to continually seek a balance between those things that can be governed by the market and those which public authorities have a duty to regulate .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are also to discuss the Montfort report this week , which Parliament wants to use to promote an entrepreneurial way of thinking .
it is therefore particularly apt to acknowledge three things in this debate .
firstly , the fact that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights has now been drafted , Article 16 of which establishes the right to entrepreneurial freedom .
of course , this right demands strict competition law , because only this will guarantee fair competition .
it protects consumers and investors .
secondly , it is only right that we should acknowledge the highly commendable book by Karel van Miert , which tells us about the means employed by entrepreneurs to bring pressure to bear on other entrepreneurs .
thirdly therefore , I would like to congratulate the Commission and its staff on the actions and decisions they have taken in the field of competition law , previously under Karel van Miert and now under your overall control , Professor Monti .
against this background , you have reworked a communication on services of general interest and set out the legal situation once again .
this statement contains three important messages .
firstly , the Member States have the right to define everything that belongs under this heading .
secondly , the Member States have the right to inject supplementary funding if it would otherwise be impossible to maintain these activities .
and thirdly - and this is highly relevant to this debate - there must of course be no areas which are exempt from competition law .
it is therefore possible to see why renationalisation would spell trouble .
it must not annul the general validity of Community law .
hence those articles in the motions for resolutions which point to this fact , including the need for transparency , are particularly valuable .
, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
( ES ) Mr President , I would first like to apologise for having arrived late .
secondly , I would like to welcome the work done by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen , with whom I have had an excellent and constructive relationship .
and obviously , Mr President , although my opinion refers to the Commission &apos; s 29th report on competition policy , it is inevitable at such a time that we will look to the past , but for no other reason than in order to learn for the future .
it has been said - and I am only going to pick up on what has been said so far - that competition is presently the big word in our society , it is the great catalyst for the development of our society , particularly of our European society .
therefore , Mr President , we need to recognise that , with Member States that are ceasing to be producers and becoming regulators , the Commission policy needs to change , and in this sense , this report is part of that important development .
in its opinion , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market did nothing more than highlight something which has been said and repeated : that we need clear rules , because this is the only way of knowing what the rules of play are .
we cannot leave everything to the market with no regulation at all .
what we need are clear rules and - I stress - rules that are of a sufficient level or category .
in any event , interpretations or interpretative communications are no good .
and also , of course , that the Commission &apos; s policy , which we welcome and support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , should not be shaped , in this process of decentralisation , to the detriment of small and medium-sized businesses , to the detriment of the citizens .
I will end with a phrase from John Rawls , the philosopher of law : inequalities are always justified when they increase the level of the system and support the weakest without affecting fundamental rights .
Commissioner , knowing how far this goes in the universal service , in public service , is the great challenge for the Commission .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Parliament in general for the great interest that it has once again displayed in matters of competition .
Mr heartfelt thanks to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her valuable contribution as rapporteur of the XXIXth report on competition policy .
a big thank you to Mr Evans as well , for his excellent report on the rules governing State aid to the steel industry and on the eighth survey on State aid in the European Union .
all three reports assume considerable importance in the light of the efforts the Commission has made to increase the transparency of its competition policy and to explain what it is doing to the citizens .
on the subject of explaining competition policy , I would like to say that I am extremely pleased with the success of the first two European Competition days , which were held in Lisbon on 9 June and in Paris on 17 October this year .
the idea was conceived in this Parliament and developed by Parliament and the Commission .
my feeling is that , together , we are making progress in helping the citizens to understand this policy .
I would like to stress that I fully agree with much of what has been said and with very many of the points contained in the resolutions .
Mr President , in the time available to me , I would like to focus on the following three points : the modernisation of Community competition law , the practical application of competition rules in 1999 and State aid .
on the subject of modernisation , I will attempt , within the constraints imposed , to respond to some of the extremely interesting points which have been raised .
the annual report on competition policy emphasises the need to modernise the legislative and interpretative framework of Community competition law in the areas of both monopolies and State aid .
I will not go into the details of the reform projects which have recently been completed or are still being developed , for they have already been the subject of a specific consultation process between the Commission and Parliament , or will be in the future , in the constructive dialogue which is so valuable .
with regard to State aid , in my opinion , the entry into force , in 1999 , of the Rules of Procedure was a considerable step forward .
they increase transparency and establish the deadlines for adopting the decisions on State aid .
as far as monopolies are concerned , the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on the matter on 27 September last .
a great many observations made by Parliament during consultation over the White Paper were taken into account even as early as at the stage of drawing up the proposal .
particular attention was paid to the concerns expressed by Parliament regarding renationalisation and legal certainty .
I would therefore like to assure Mrs Palacio , Mr Karas and the other Members who spoke on these points that the regulation takes their concerns into ample consideration .
I am now waiting for the commencement of the second stage of dialogue between our two institutions on these legislative proposals and I am sure that it will be as constructive as the first stage .
as you know , on 9 and 10 November , the Commission and Parliament are jointly organising a conference on this reform in Freiburg , a conference proposed for the first time precisely in your resolution on the White Paper .
my second point is the application of the competition rules during 1999 .
in the year in question , there were an unusually large number of cases requiring the use of considerable resources and which were closed by formal decisions .
one of the things I appreciate is your call for an increase in human resources .
the Commission has continued to intervene resolutely , particularly where cartels and abuse of a dominating position are concerned .
as in the debate on mergers , since time is limited and I prefer to attempt to answer some of the specific questions , I will not mention the major - albeit numerous - interventions we have made .
the third point is State aid .
I am happy to note the support which Parliament continues to lend us in relation to the eighth survey too .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s proposals on the future development of these information tools , which will include the register and the scoreboard as well as audits .
I confirm to Mr Evans and the other Members who have spoken on this subject that we will be ready to present the initial versions of the register and the scoreboard - Mrs Riis-Jørgensen also upholds this idea - before June 2001 , and I am confident that transparency will be an important additional tool for the application of the legal instruments governing State aid .
Mr President , I would now like to focus on at least some of the specific points raised .
several Members - Mrs Riis-Jørgensen , Mr Schmidt , Mr Blokland and Mrs Kauppi - have posed the problem of large companies operating in relatively small countries .
could we not relax the definition of the relevant market there , when it comes to merger operations ?
well , if the relevant market , on the basis of the analysis conducted , happens to be national in scope , you must realise that doing what you suggest would amount to discrimination against the consumers and customers in those national markets .
what we have to work together for is to gradually establish in the marketplace the reality of a single market going beyond the national market .
otherwise we would be serving our purpose of helping competition and the consumers in a perverse way .
I add , in relation to the specific Volvo-Scania case that I am sure underlies many speakers &apos; remarks , that both companies have been able to reach solutions that make their own further international growth compatible with the protection of the interests of competition and consumers in those markets .
should we introduce a panel of independent experts to assess mergers ?
the recourse to external expertise can be useful and already takes place in a number of cases .
but the Commission should not and will not give its ultimate responsibility of taking decisions to an external body .
it belongs to us .
it may , on occasion , be uncomfortable , but this is our task .
concerning the problem of one DG Competition official who resigned , I have already expressed my regret about that resignation .
further increasing the right of defence , the transparency of the procedures , including the enhanced position of the hearing officer , is something to which I am very much attached and upon which I am reflecting , taking into account several inputs including the useful ideas provided by that official before he resigned .
as far as Korea is concerned , Mr Lamy , who will be coming here during the course of the week , will be better placed to update you on the latest developments .
I can only , for my part , state my conviction that any extension of operating state aids to shipyards would not be the appropriate response to a situation that requires other types of intervention .
Mr Evans , I very much share your concern on the issue of state aids to financial services .
we will pursue that point with determination .
Mr Rapkay , it has been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament in pursuit of its competition policy and I do not feel that this support may fade away .
looking at the resolutions we are discussing today , I see the Commission &apos; s policy as very much in line with a vigorous implementation of those resolutions .
in the area notably of state aids , it must not be thought that the Commission believes in a pure or ultra-liberal policy .
State aids have their place but it is a fact that in many cases the concrete manifestation of state aids goes well beyond what the Treaty allows and what the guidelines allow .
but believe me , I certainly see competition policy as an instrument of a social market economy .
the stronger the implementation of competition the better the market tends to be .
there is full scope for social aspects provided they are not mixed up in a non-transparent way with the functioning of the market .
you mentioned Deutsche Post : for example , procedures are currently in progress at the Commission on Deutsche Post in respect of both these areas , and I can assure you that the Commission does not intend the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam on public television broadcasting to create a condition preventing appropriate control of State aid on this matter as well .
in this regard , and as far as State aid is concerned , I refer you to the Communication adopted by the Commission on 20 September on services of general economic interest .
Mr President , I think I have exceeded the time allowed to me .
I apologise to those to whose questions I have not had time to respond .
I would , however , like to end by quoting the report of the Legal Affairs Committee .
it states , Mrs Palacio :
all too often Commission decisions in the field of competition are presented in the press as defeats for national interests rather than victories for the internal market and for the consumer . &apos;
our intention is to have more and more of these victories and to be more and more able to explain them to European consumers and to European citizens .
of course , Parliament has a very important role to play in this respect .
Mr President , I would just like to set the record straight for the benefit of the Commissioner .
I would not presume to speak on behalf of the whole of Parliament , and certainly not in advance of a vote on the matter .
I merely want to clarify that I spoke here on behalf of the second largest group , and expressed a real concern of ours , and if you heard Mr Caudron speak , then you would be aware that this is not something I alone am concerned about , because it is also something that bothers another MEP .
and so I only spoke on behalf of my Group , and not for Parliament as a whole .
the debate is closed .
