Abilify can be take with or without food .
the daily dose of Abilify should not exceed 30 mg , but this dose should be use with caution in patient who have severe problem with their liver .
the dose of Abilify should be adjust in patient who be take other medicine that be break down in the same way a Abilify .
Abilify have not be study in child age below 18 year or adult age over 65 year .
for more information , see the Package Leaflet .
how do Abilify work ?
the active substance in Abilify , aripiprazole , be an antipsychotic medicine .
it exact mechanism of action be unknown , but it attach to several different receptor on the surface of nerve cell in the brain .
this disrupt signal transmit between brain cell by ‘ neurotransmitter ’ , chemical that allow nerve cell to communicate with each other .
Aripiprazole be think to act mainly by be a ‘ partial agonist ’ for the receptor for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine ( also call serotonin ) .
this mean that aripiprazole act like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine to activate the receptor , but to a less extent than the neurotransmitter .
since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine be involve in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , aripiprazole help to normalise the activity of the brain , reduce psychotic or manic symptom and prevent them from return .
how have Abilify be study ?
for the treatment of schizophrenia , there be three main short-term study of Abilify tablet last four to six week , which involve 1,203 patient and compare Abilify with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
the effectiveness of Abilify in prevent symptom from return be assess in three study last up to a year , two of which use haloperidol ( another antipsychotic medicine ) a a comparator .
the effectiveness of the solution for injection be compare with placebo over a period of two hour in two study involve 805 patient with schizophrenia or related condition who be experience symptom of agitation .
all of the study measure the change in the patient ’ s symptom use a standard scale for schizophrenia .
for the treatment of bipolar disorder , there be eight main study look at Abilify take by mouth .
there be five short-term study that compare the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo over three week in a total of 1,900 patient .
two of these study use haloperidol and lithium ( another antipsychotic medicine ) a comparators and continue for a further nine week to look at the maintenance of the effect of the medicine .
another study compare Abilify with haloperidol over 12 week in 347 patient , and a further study compare the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo in prevent recurrence in 160 patient whose manic symptom have already be stabilise use Abilify .
the eighth study look at the effect of add Abilify or placebo to exist treatment with lithium or valproate ( another antipsychotic medicine ) in 384 patient .
the effectiveness of Abilify solution for injection be compare with that of lorazepam ( another antipsychotic medicine ) and of placebo over a period of two hour in one study involve 301 patient with bipolar disorder who be experience symptom of agitation .
all of these study look at the change in symptom use a standard scale for bipolar disorder or at the number of patient who respond to treatment .
the company also carry out study look at the absorption of the orodispersible tablet and oral solution by the body .
what benefit have Abilify show during the study ?
when use to treat schizophrenia , Abilify be more effective than placebo in the short-term study .
in the long-term study , Abilify be more effective than placebo , and as effective a haloperidol , after up to a year of treatment .
in both study of the solution for injection , patient receive Abilify at dos of 5.25 , 9.75 or 15 mg have a significantly great reduction in symptom of agitation than those receive placebo .
when use to treat bipolar disorder , Abilify be more effective than placebo at reduce manic symptom in four of the five short-term study .
Abilify also have a similar effect to haloperidol and to lithium over three week .
this effect be maintain for up to 12 week .
Abilify be also more effective than placebo at prevent manic episode return in previously treat patient for up to 74 week , and when it be use a an add-on to exist treatment .
injection of Abilify at dos of 10 or 15 mg be also more effective than placebo in reduce the symptom of agitation , and be of similar effectiveness to lorazepam .
2 / 3 What be the risk associate with Abilify ?
Akathisia be more common in patient with bipolar disorder than in those with schizophrenia .
between 1 and 10 patient in 100 receive injection of Abilify experience somnolence , dizziness , headache , akathisia , nausea and vomiting .
for the full list of all side effect report with Abilify , see the Package Leaflet .
Abilify should not be use in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to aripiprazole or any of the other ingredient .
why have Abilify be approve ?
the Committee for medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decide that Abilify ’ s benefit be great than it risk for the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder , and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experience predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode respond to aripiprazole treatment .
it also decide that the benefit of the solution for injection outweigh it risk for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviour in patient with schizophrenia or in patient with manic episode in bipolar I disorder , when oral therapy be not appropriate .
the Committee recommend that Abilify be give market authorisation .

4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY be indicate for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY be indicate for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experience predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode respond to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhance efficacy at dose high than a daily dose of 15 mg have not be demonstrate although individual patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 15 mg administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for prevent recurrence of manic episode in patient who have be receive aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , include dose reduction should be consider on the basis of clinical status .
child and adolescent : there be no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment be require for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available be insufficient to establish recommendation .
however , the
2 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be use with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment be require in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or old have not be establish .
owe to the great sensitivity of this population , a low start dose should be consider when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment be require for female patient a compare to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoke status : accord to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment be require for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduce .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor be withdraw from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increase ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increase .
when the CYP3A4 inducer be withdraw from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduce to the recommend dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitor throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour be inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case have be report early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , include treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study find that there be no increase risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compare to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , include accelerate or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation be comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or less duration , there be uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be consider .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS be a potentially fatal symptom complex associate with antipsychotic medicinal product .
clinical manifestation of NMS be hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , alter
3 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevate creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also be report .
if a patient develop sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , include ABILIFY , must be discontinue .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associate with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increase mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associate with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treat with aripiprazole be at increase risk of death compare to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient be 3.5 % compare to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death be vary , most of the death appear to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , include fatality , be report in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient report cerebrovascular adverse event compare with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference be not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there be a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treat with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY be not approve for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associate with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , have be report in patient treat with atypical antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there be no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( include diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compare to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treat with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent be not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treat with any antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY , should be observe for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitor regularly for worsen of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain be commonly see in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic know to cause weight gain , poorly manage life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain have be report post-marketing among patient prescribe ABILIFY .
when see , it be usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have be associate with antipsychotic drug use , include ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be use cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterise by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4 4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole have the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
give the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be use when aripiprazole be take in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlap undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with medicine know to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be use .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect be deem not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole be metabolise by multiple pathway involve the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment be require for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increase aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax be unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decrease by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increase aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increase by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in high plasma concentration of aripiprazole compare to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when consider concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increase to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 be use concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expect .
follow concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole be 68 % and 73 % low , respectively , compare to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) be administer alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration be 69 % and 71 % low , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be double when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occur with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduce to the recommend dose .
5 When either valproate or lithium be administer concomitantly with aripiprazole , there be no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole have no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole do not show potential for alter CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole be unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediate by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there be no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advise to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raise by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be use in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole be excrete in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it be not know whether aripiprazole be excrete in human milk .
patient should be advise not to breast feed if they be take aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have be perform .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be caution about operate hazardous machine , include motor vehicle , until they be reasonably certain that aripiprazole do not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the follow undesirable effect occur more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or be identify a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency list below be define use the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
6 Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient have an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS include parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compare with those treat with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week control trial , the incidence of EPS be 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS be 26.6 % for patient treat with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treat with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient be 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia be 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experience potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter reveal no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , be observe in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compare to 2.0 % of patient who receive placebo .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone be identify in adult patient with report estimate dose up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observe included lethargy , increase blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomit and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have be receive with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom report included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintain an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be consider .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be start immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
follow any confirm or suspect overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
activate charcoal ( 50 g ) , administer one hour after aripiprazole , decrease aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggest that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there be no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis be unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole be highly bind to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
8 It have be propose that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be mediate through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibit antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibit high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibit moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos range from 0.5 to 30 mg administer once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produce a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detect by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involve 1,228 schizophrenic patient , present with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole be associate with statistically significantly great improvement in psychotic symptom compare to placebo .
ABILIFY be effective in maintain the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have show an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintain response to medicinal product at 52-weeks be similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate be significantly high for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale use a secondary endpoint , include PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale show a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole have significantly great reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 week .
these trial include patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole fail to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrate a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole be well absorb , with peak plasma concentration occur within 3-5 hour after dose .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation be 87 % .
there be no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole be widely distribute throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicate extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be great than 99 % bound to serum protein , bind primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole be extensively metabolise by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
base on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme be responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation be catalyse by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole be the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represent about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole be approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole be 0.7 ml / min / kg , which be primarily hepatic .
follow a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity be recover in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole be excrete in the urine and approximately 18 % be recover unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and young adult subject , nor be there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor be there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation have reveal no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoke upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be find to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compare to young healthy subject .
10 Hepatic Disease :
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for human base on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect be observe only at dos or exposure that be sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicate that these effect be limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the high nontumorigenic exposure in female rat be 7 time the human exposure at the recommend dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the high dose propose , 30 mg per day , be no more than 6 % of the bile concentration find in the monkey in the 39-week study and be well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
base on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole be consider non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole do not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , include dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , be observe in rat at dos result in subtherapeutic exposure ( base on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos result in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommend clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occur at dos similar to those elicit developmental toxicity .

Schizophrenia :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhance efficacy at dose high than a daily dose of 15 mg have not be demonstrate although individual patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 15 mg administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for prevent recurrence of manic episode in patient who have be receive aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , include dose reduction should be consider on the basis of clinical status .
child and adolescent : there be no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment be require for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available be insufficient to establish recommendation .
however , the
13 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be use with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment be require in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or old have not be establish .
owe to the great sensitivity of this population , a low start dose should be consider when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment be require for female patient a compare to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoke status : accord to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment be require for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduce .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor be withdraw from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increase ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increase .
when the CYP3A4 inducer be withdraw from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduce to the recommend dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitor throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour be inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case have be report early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , include treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study find that there be no increase risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compare to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , include accelerate or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation be comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or less duration , there be uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be consider .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS be a potentially fatal symptom complex associate with antipsychotic medicinal product .
clinical manifestation of NMS be hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , alter
14 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevate creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also be report .
if a patient develop sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , include ABILIFY , must be discontinue .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associate with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increase mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associate with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treat with aripiprazole be at increase risk of death compare to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient be 3.5 % compare to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death be vary , most of the death appear to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , include fatality , be report in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient report cerebrovascular adverse event compare with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference be not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there be a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treat with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY be not approve for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associate with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , have be report in patient treat with atypical antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there be no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( include diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compare to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treat with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent be not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treat with any antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY , should be observe for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitor regularly for worsen of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain be commonly see in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic know to cause weight gain , poorly manage life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain have be report post-marketing among patient prescribe ABILIFY .
when see , it be usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have be associate with antipsychotic drug use , include ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be use cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterise by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
15 4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole have the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
give the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be use when aripiprazole be take in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlap undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with medicine know to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be use .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect be deem not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole be metabolise by multiple pathway involve the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment be require for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increase aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax be unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decrease by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increase aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increase by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in high plasma concentration of aripiprazole compare to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when consider concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increase to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 be use concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expect .
follow concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole be 68 % and 73 % low , respectively , compare to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) be administer alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration be 69 % and 71 % low , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be double when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occur with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduce to the recommend dose .
16 When either valproate or lithium be administer concomitantly with aripiprazole , there be no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole have no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole do not show potential for alter CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole be unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediate by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there be no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advise to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raise by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be use in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole be excrete in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it be not know whether aripiprazole be excrete in human milk .
patient should be advise not to breast feed if they be take aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have be perform .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be caution about operate hazardous machine , include motor vehicle , until they be reasonably certain that aripiprazole do not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the follow undesirable effect occur more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or be identify a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency list below be define use the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
17 Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient have an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS include parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compare with those treat with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .

Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS be 26.6 % for patient treat with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treat with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient be 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia be 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experience potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter reveal no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , be observe in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compare to 2.0 % of patient who receive placebo .
other finding :

the potentially medically important sign and symptom observe included lethargy , increase blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomit and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have be receive with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom report included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintain an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be consider .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be start immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
follow any confirm or suspect overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
activate charcoal ( 50 g ) , administer one hour after aripiprazole , decrease aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggest that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there be no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis be unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole be highly bind to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
19 It have be propose that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be mediate through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibit antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibit high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibit moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos range from 0.5 to 30 mg administer once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produce a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detect by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involve 1,228 schizophrenic patient , present with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole be associate with statistically significantly great improvement in psychotic symptom compare to placebo .
ABILIFY be effective in maintain the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have show an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintain response to medicinal product at 52-weeks be similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate be significantly high for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale use a secondary endpoint , include PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale show a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole have significantly great reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 week .
these trial include patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole fail to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrate a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole be well absorb , with peak plasma concentration occur within 3-5 hour after dose .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation be 87 % .
there be no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole be widely distribute throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicate extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be great than 99 % bound to serum protein , bind primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole be extensively metabolise by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
base on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme be responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation be catalyse by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole be the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represent about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole be approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole be 0.7 ml / min / kg , which be primarily hepatic .
follow a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity be recover in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole be excrete in the urine and approximately 18 % be recover unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and young adult subject , nor be there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor be there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation have reveal no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoke upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be find to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compare to young healthy subject .
21 Hepatic Disease :
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for human base on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect be observe only at dos or exposure that be sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicate that these effect be limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the high nontumorigenic exposure in female rat be 7 time the human exposure at the recommend dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the high dose propose , 30 mg per day , be no more than 6 % of the bile concentration find in the monkey in the 39-week study and be well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
base on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole be consider non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole do not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , include dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , be observe in rat at dos result in subtherapeutic exposure ( base on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos result in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommend clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occur at dos similar to those elicit developmental toxicity .

Schizophrenia :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhance efficacy at dose high than a daily dose of 15 mg have not be demonstrate although individual patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 15 mg administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for prevent recurrence of manic episode in patient who have be receive aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , include dose reduction should be consider on the basis of clinical status .
child and adolescent : there be no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment be require for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available be insufficient to establish recommendation .
however , the
24 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be use with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment be require in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or old have not be establish .
owe to the great sensitivity of this population , a low start dose should be consider when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment be require for female patient a compare to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoke status : accord to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment be require for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduce .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor be withdraw from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increase ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increase .
when the CYP3A4 inducer be withdraw from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduce to the recommend dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitor throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour be inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case have be report early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , include treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study find that there be no increase risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compare to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , include accelerate or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation be comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or less duration , there be uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be consider .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS be a potentially fatal symptom complex associate with antipsychotic medicinal product .
clinical manifestation of NMS be hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , alter
25 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevate creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also be report .
if a patient develop sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , include ABILIFY , must be discontinue .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associate with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increase mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associate with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treat with aripiprazole be at increase risk of death compare to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient be 3.5 % compare to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death be vary , most of the death appear to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , include fatality , be report in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient report cerebrovascular adverse event compare with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference be not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there be a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treat with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY be not approve for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associate with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , have be report in patient treat with atypical antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there be no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( include diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compare to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treat with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent be not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treat with any antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY , should be observe for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitor regularly for worsen of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain be commonly see in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic know to cause weight gain , poorly manage life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain have be report post-marketing among patient prescribe ABILIFY .
when see , it be usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have be associate with antipsychotic drug use , include ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be use cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterise by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
26 4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole have the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
give the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be use when aripiprazole be take in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlap undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with medicine know to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be use .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect be deem not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole be metabolise by multiple pathway involve the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment be require for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increase aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax be unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decrease by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increase aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increase by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in high plasma concentration of aripiprazole compare to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when consider concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increase to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 be use concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expect .
follow concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole be 68 % and 73 % low , respectively , compare to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) be administer alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration be 69 % and 71 % low , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be double when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occur with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduce to the recommend dose .
27 When either valproate or lithium be administer concomitantly with aripiprazole , there be no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole have no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole do not show potential for alter CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole be unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediate by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there be no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advise to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raise by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be use in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole be excrete in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it be not know whether aripiprazole be excrete in human milk .
patient should be advise not to breast feed if they be take aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have be perform .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be caution about operate hazardous machine , include motor vehicle , until they be reasonably certain that aripiprazole do not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the follow undesirable effect occur more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or be identify a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency list below be define use the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
28 Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient have an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS include parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compare with those treat with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week control trial , the incidence of EPS be 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS be 26.6 % for patient treat with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treat with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient be 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia be 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experience potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter reveal no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , be observe in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compare to 2.0 % of patient who receive placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect know to be associate with antipsychotic therapy and also report during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone be identify in adult patient with report estimate dose up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observe included lethargy , increase blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomit and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have be receive with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom report included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintain an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be consider .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be start immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
follow any confirm or suspect overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
activate charcoal ( 50 g ) , administer one hour after aripiprazole , decrease aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggest that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there be no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis be unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole be highly bind to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
30 It have be propose that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be mediate through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibit antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibit high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibit moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos range from 0.5 to 30 mg administer once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produce a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detect by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involve 1,228 schizophrenic patient , present with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole be associate with statistically significantly great improvement in psychotic symptom compare to placebo .
ABILIFY be effective in maintain the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have show an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintain response to medicinal product at 52-weeks be similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate be significantly high for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale use a secondary endpoint , include PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale show a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole have significantly great reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 week .
these trial include patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole fail to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrate a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole be well absorb , with peak plasma concentration occur within 3-5 hour after dose .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .

at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be great than 99 % bound to serum protein , bind primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole be extensively metabolise by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
base on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme be responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation be catalyse by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole be the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represent about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .

the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole be approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole be 0.7 ml / min / kg , which be primarily hepatic .
follow a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity be recover in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole be excrete in the urine and approximately 18 % be recover unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and young adult subject , nor be there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor be there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation have reveal no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoke upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be find to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compare to young healthy subject .

Schizophrenia :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhance efficacy at dose high than a daily dose of 15 mg have not be demonstrate although individual patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 15 mg administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for prevent recurrence of manic episode in patient who have be receive aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , include dose reduction should be consider on the basis of clinical status .
child and adolescent : there be no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment be require for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available be insufficient to establish recommendation .
however , the
35 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be use with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment be require in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or old have not be establish .
owe to the great sensitivity of this population , a low start dose should be consider when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment be require for female patient a compare to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoke status : accord to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment be require for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduce .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor be withdraw from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increase ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increase .
when the CYP3A4 inducer be withdraw from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduce to the recommend dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitor throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour be inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case have be report early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , include treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study find that there be no increase risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compare to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , include accelerate or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation be comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or less duration , there be uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be consider .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS be a potentially fatal symptom complex associate with antipsychotic medicinal product .
clinical manifestation of NMS be hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , alter
36 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevate creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also be report .
if a patient develop sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , include ABILIFY , must be discontinue .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associate with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increase mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associate with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treat with aripiprazole be at increase risk of death compare to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient be 3.5 % compare to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death be vary , most of the death appear to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , include fatality , be report in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient report cerebrovascular adverse event compare with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference be not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there be a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treat with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY be not approve for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associate with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , have be report in patient treat with atypical antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there be no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( include diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compare to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treat with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent be not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treat with any antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY , should be observe for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitor regularly for worsen of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain be commonly see in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic know to cause weight gain , poorly manage life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain have be report post-marketing among patient prescribe ABILIFY .
when see , it be usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have be associate with antipsychotic drug use , include ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be use cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterise by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
37 4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole have the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
give the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be use when aripiprazole be take in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlap undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with medicine know to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be use .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect be deem not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole be metabolise by multiple pathway involve the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment be require for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increase aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax be unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decrease by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increase aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increase by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in high plasma concentration of aripiprazole compare to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when consider concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increase to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 be use concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expect .
follow concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole be 68 % and 73 % low , respectively , compare to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) be administer alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration be 69 % and 71 % low , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be double when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occur with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduce to the recommend dose .
38 When either valproate or lithium be administer concomitantly with aripiprazole , there be no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole have no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole do not show potential for alter CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole be unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediate by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there be no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advise to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raise by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be use in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole be excrete in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it be not know whether aripiprazole be excrete in human milk .
patient should be advise not to breast feed if they be take aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have be perform .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be caution about operate hazardous machine , include motor vehicle , until they be reasonably certain that aripiprazole do not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the follow undesirable effect occur more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or be identify a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency list below be define use the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
39 Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient have an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS include parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compare with those treat with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week control trial , the incidence of EPS be 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS be 26.6 % for patient treat with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treat with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient be 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia be 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experience potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter reveal no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , be observe in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compare to 2.0 % of patient who receive placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect know to be associate with antipsychotic therapy and also report during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone be identify in adult patient with report estimate dose up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observe included lethargy , increase blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomit and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have be receive with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom report included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintain an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be consider .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be start immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
follow any confirm or suspect overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
activate charcoal ( 50 g ) , administer one hour after aripiprazole , decrease aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggest that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there be no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis be unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole be highly bind to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
41 It have be propose that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be mediate through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibit antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibit high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibit moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos range from 0.5 to 30 mg administer once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produce a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detect by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involve 1,228 schizophrenic patient , present with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole be associate with statistically significantly great improvement in psychotic symptom compare to placebo .
ABILIFY be effective in maintain the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have show an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintain response to medicinal product at 52-weeks be similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate be significantly high for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale use a secondary endpoint , include PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale show a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole have significantly great reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 week .
these trial include patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole fail to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrate a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole be well absorb , with peak plasma concentration occur within 3-5 hour after dose .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation be 87 % .
there be no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole be widely distribute throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicate extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be great than 99 % bound to serum protein , bind primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole be extensively metabolise by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
base on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme be responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation be catalyse by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole be the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represent about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY be indicate for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY be indicate for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experience predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode respond to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhance efficacy at dose high than a daily dose of 15 mg have not be demonstrate although individual patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 15 mg administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for prevent recurrence of manic episode in patient who have be receive aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , include dose reduction should be consider on the basis of clinical status .
the orodispersible tablet should be place in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
it can be take with or without liquid .
removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth be difficult .
since the orodispersible tablet be fragile , it should be take immediately on open the blister .
alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
46 The orodispersible tablet may be use a an alternative to ABILIFY tablet for patient who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablet ( see also section 5.2 ) .
child and adolescent : there be no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment be require for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available be insufficient to establish recommendation .
in these patient dose should be manage cautiously .
however , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be use with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment be require in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or old have not be establish .
owe to the great sensitivity of this population , a low start dose should be consider when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment be require for female patient a compare to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoke status : accord to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment be require for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduce .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor be withdraw from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increase ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increase .
when the CYP3A4 inducer be withdraw from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduce to the recommend dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitor throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour be inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case have be report early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , include treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study find that there be no increase risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compare to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , include accelerate or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation be comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
47 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or less duration , there be uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be consider .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS be a potentially fatal symptom complex associate with antipsychotic medicinal product .
in clinical trial , rare case of NMS be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
clinical manifestation of NMS be hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , alter mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevate creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also be report .
if a patient develop sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , include ABILIFY , must be discontinue .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associate with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increase mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associate with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treat with aripiprazole be at increase risk of death compare to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient be 3.5 % compare to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death be vary , most of the death appear to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , include fatality , be report in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient report cerebrovascular adverse event compare with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference be not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there be a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treat with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY be not approve for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associate with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , have be report in patient treat with atypical antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there be no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( include diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compare to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treat with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent be not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treat with any antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY , should be observe for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitor regularly for worsen of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain be commonly see in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic know to cause weight gain , poorly manage life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain have be report post-marketing among patient prescribe ABILIFY .
when see , it be usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
48 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have be associate with antipsychotic drug use , include ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be use cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Phenylketonurics :
ABILIFY orodispersible tablet contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterise by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole have the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
give the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be use when aripiprazole be take in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlap undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with medicine know to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be use .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect be deem not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole be metabolise by multiple pathway involve the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment be require for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increase aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax be unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decrease by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increase aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increase by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in high plasma concentration of aripiprazole compare to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when consider concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increase to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 be use concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expect .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean
49 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration be 69 % and 71 % low , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be double when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occur with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduce to the recommend dose .
when either valproate or lithium be administer concomitantly with aripiprazole , there be no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole have no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole do not show potential for alter CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole be unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediate by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there be no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advise to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raise by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be use in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole be excrete in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it be not know whether aripiprazole be excrete in human milk .
patient should be advise not to breast feed if they be take aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have be perform .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be caution about operate hazardous machine , include motor vehicle , until they be reasonably certain that aripiprazole do not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the follow undesirable effect occur more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or be identify a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency list below be define use the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient have an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS include parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compare with those treat with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week control trial , the incidence of EPS be 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS be 26.6 % for patient treat with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treat with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient be 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia be 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experience potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter reveal no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , be observe in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compare to 2.0 % of patient who receive placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect know to be associate with antipsychotic therapy and also report during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone be identify in adult patient with report estimate dose up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observe included lethargy , increase blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomit and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have be receive with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom report included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintain an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be consider .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be start immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
follow any confirm or suspect overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
52 activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administer one hour after aripiprazole , decrease aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggest that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there be no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis be unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole be highly bind to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
it have be propose that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be mediate through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibit antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibit high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibit moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos range from 0.5 to 30 mg administer once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produce a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detect by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involve 1,228 schizophrenic patient , present with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole be associate with statistically significantly great improvement in psychotic symptom compare to placebo .
ABILIFY be effective in maintain the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have show an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintain response to medicinal product at 52-weeks be similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate be significantly high for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale use a secondary endpoint , include PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale show a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole have significantly great reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo in
these trial include patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole fail to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrate a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
in a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , who be partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum level , the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy result in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet be bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablet , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet may be use a an alternative to aripiprazole tablet .
absorption :
Aripiprazole be well absorb , with peak plasma concentration occur within 3-5 hour after dose .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation be 87 % .
there be no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole be widely distribute throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicate extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be great than 99 % bound to serum protein , bind primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole be extensively metabolise by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
base on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme be responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation be catalyse by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole be the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represent about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole be approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole be 0.7 ml / min / kg , which be primarily hepatic .
follow a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity be recover in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole be excrete in the urine and approximately 18 % be recover unchanged in the faeces .
54 Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and young adult subject , nor be there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor be there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation have reveal no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoke upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be find to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compare to young healthy subject .
Hepatic Disease :
a single-dose study in subject with vary degree of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A , B , and C ) do not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study include only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis , which be insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for human base on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect be observe only at dos or exposure that be sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicate that these effect be limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the high nontumorigenic exposure in female rat be 7 time the human exposure at the recommend dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the high dose propose , 30 mg per day , be no more than 6 % of the bile concentration find in the monkey in the 39-week study and be well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
base on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole be consider non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole do not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , include dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , be observe in rat at dos result in subtherapeutic exposure ( base on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos result in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommend clinical dose .

4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY be indicate for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY be indicate for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experience predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode respond to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhance efficacy at dose high than a daily dose of 15 mg have not be demonstrate although individual patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 15 mg administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for prevent recurrence of manic episode in patient who have be receive aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , include dose reduction should be consider on the basis of clinical status .
the orodispersible tablet should be place in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
it can be take with or without liquid .
removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth be difficult .
since the orodispersible tablet be fragile , it should be take immediately on open the blister .
alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
58 The orodispersible tablet may be use a an alternative to ABILIFY tablet for patient who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablet ( see also section 5.2 ) .
child and adolescent : there be no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment be require for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available be insufficient to establish recommendation .
in these patient dose should be manage cautiously .
however , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be use with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment be require in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or old have not be establish .
owe to the great sensitivity of this population , a low start dose should be consider when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment be require for female patient a compare to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoke status : accord to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment be require for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduce .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor be withdraw from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increase ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increase .
when the CYP3A4 inducer be withdraw from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduce to the recommend dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitor throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour be inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case have be report early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , include treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study find that there be no increase risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compare to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , include accelerate or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation be comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
59 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or less duration , there be uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be consider .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS be a potentially fatal symptom complex associate with antipsychotic medicinal product .
in clinical trial , rare case of NMS be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
clinical manifestation of NMS be hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , alter mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevate creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also be report .
if a patient develop sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , include ABILIFY , must be discontinue .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associate with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increase mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associate with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treat with aripiprazole be at increase risk of death compare to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient be 3.5 % compare to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death be vary , most of the death appear to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , include fatality , be report in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient report cerebrovascular adverse event compare with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference be not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there be a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treat with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY be not approve for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associate with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , have be report in patient treat with atypical antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there be no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( include diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compare to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treat with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent be not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treat with any antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY , should be observe for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitor regularly for worsen of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain be commonly see in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic know to cause weight gain , poorly manage life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain have be report post-marketing among patient prescribe ABILIFY .
when see , it be usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
60 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have be associate with antipsychotic drug use , include ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be use cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Phenylketonurics :
ABILIFY orodispersible tablet contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterise by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole have the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
give the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be use when aripiprazole be take in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlap undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with medicine know to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be use .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect be deem not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole be metabolise by multiple pathway involve the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment be require for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increase aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax be unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decrease by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increase aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increase by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in high plasma concentration of aripiprazole compare to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when consider concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increase to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 be use concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expect .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean
61 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration be 69 % and 71 % low , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be double when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occur with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduce to the recommend dose .
when either valproate or lithium be administer concomitantly with aripiprazole , there be no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole have no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole do not show potential for alter CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole be unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediate by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there be no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advise to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raise by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be use in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole be excrete in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it be not know whether aripiprazole be excrete in human milk .
patient should be advise not to breast feed if they be take aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have be perform .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be caution about operate hazardous machine , include motor vehicle , until they be reasonably certain that aripiprazole do not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the follow undesirable effect occur more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or be identify a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency list below be define use the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient have an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS include parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compare with those treat with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week control trial , the incidence of EPS be 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS be 26.6 % for patient treat with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treat with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient be 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia be 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experience potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter reveal no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , be observe in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compare to 2.0 % of patient who receive placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect know to be associate with antipsychotic therapy and also report during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone be identify in adult patient with report estimate dose up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observe included lethargy , increase blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomit and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have be receive with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom report included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintain an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be consider .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be start immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
follow any confirm or suspect overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
64 activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administer one hour after aripiprazole , decrease aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggest that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there be no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis be unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole be highly bind to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
it have be propose that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be mediate through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibit antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibit high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibit moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos range from 0.5 to 30 mg administer once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produce a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detect by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involve 1,228 schizophrenic patient , present with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole be associate with statistically significantly great improvement in psychotic symptom compare to placebo .
ABILIFY be effective in maintain the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have show an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintain response to medicinal product at 52-weeks be similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate be significantly high for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale use a secondary endpoint , include PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale show a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole have significantly great reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo in
these trial include patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole fail to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrate a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
in a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , who be partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum level , the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy result in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet be bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablet , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet may be use a an alternative to aripiprazole tablet .
absorption :
Aripiprazole be well absorb , with peak plasma concentration occur within 3-5 hour after dose .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation be 87 % .
there be no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole be widely distribute throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicate extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be great than 99 % bound to serum protein , bind primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole be extensively metabolise by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
base on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme be responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation be catalyse by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole be the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represent about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole be approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole be 0.7 ml / min / kg , which be primarily hepatic .
follow a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity be recover in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole be excrete in the urine and approximately 18 % be recover unchanged in the faeces .
66 Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and young adult subject , nor be there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor be there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation have reveal no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoke upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be find to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compare to young healthy subject .
Hepatic Disease :
a single-dose study in subject with vary degree of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A , B , and C ) do not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study include only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis , which be insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for human base on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect be observe only at dos or exposure that be sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicate that these effect be limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the high nontumorigenic exposure in female rat be 7 time the human exposure at the recommend dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the high dose propose , 30 mg per day , be no more than 6 % of the bile concentration find in the monkey in the 39-week study and be well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
base on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole be consider non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole do not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , include dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , be observe in rat at dos result in subtherapeutic exposure ( base on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos result in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommend clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occur at dos similar to those elicit developmental toxicity .

4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY be indicate for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY be indicate for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experience predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode respond to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
oral use .
Schizophrenia :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal .
ABILIFY be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
enhance efficacy at dose high than a daily dose of 15 mg have not be demonstrate although individual patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episode :
the recommend starting dose for ABILIFY be 15 mg administer on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
some patient may benefit from a high dose .
the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
recurrence prevention of manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
for prevent recurrence of manic episode in patient who have be receive aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
adjustment of daily dosage , include dose reduction should be consider on the basis of clinical status .
the orodispersible tablet should be place in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
it can be take with or without liquid .
removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth be difficult .
since the orodispersible tablet be fragile , it should be take immediately on open the blister .
alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
70 The orodispersible tablet may be use a an alternative to ABILIFY tablet for patient who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablet ( see also section 5.2 ) .
child and adolescent : there be no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age .
patient with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment be require for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
in patient with severe hepatic impairment , the data available be insufficient to establish recommendation .
in these patient dose should be manage cautiously .
however , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be use with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
patient with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment be require in patient with renal impairment .
elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or old have not be establish .
owe to the great sensitivity of this population , a low start dose should be consider when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment be require for female patient a compare to male patient ( see section 5.2 ) .
smoke status : accord to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment be require for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduce .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor be withdraw from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increase ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increase .
when the CYP3A4 inducer be withdraw from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduce to the recommend dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitor throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour be inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case have be report early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , include treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study find that there be no increase risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compare to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , include accelerate or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation be comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
71 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or less duration , there be uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be consider .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS be a potentially fatal symptom complex associate with antipsychotic medicinal product .
in clinical trial , rare case of NMS be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
clinical manifestation of NMS be hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , alter mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevate creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also be report .
if a patient develop sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , include ABILIFY , must be discontinue .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associate with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increase mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associate with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treat with aripiprazole be at increase risk of death compare to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient be 3.5 % compare to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death be vary , most of the death appear to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , include fatality , be report in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient report cerebrovascular adverse event compare with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference be not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there be a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treat with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY be not approve for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associate with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , have be report in patient treat with atypical antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there be no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( include diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compare to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treat with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent be not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treat with any antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY , should be observe for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitor regularly for worsen of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain be commonly see in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic know to cause weight gain , poorly manage life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain have be report post-marketing among patient prescribe ABILIFY .
when see , it be usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
72 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have be associate with antipsychotic drug use , include ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be use cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Phenylketonurics :
ABILIFY orodispersible tablet contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterise by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole have the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
give the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be use when aripiprazole be take in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlap undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with medicine know to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be use .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect be deem not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole be metabolise by multiple pathway involve the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment be require for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increase aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax be unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decrease by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increase aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increase by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in high plasma concentration of aripiprazole compare to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when consider concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increase to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 be use concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expect .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean
73 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration be 69 % and 71 % low , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be double when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occur with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduce to the recommend dose .
when either valproate or lithium be administer concomitantly with aripiprazole , there be no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole have no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole do not show potential for alter CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole be unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediate by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there be no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advise to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raise by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be use in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole be excrete in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it be not know whether aripiprazole be excrete in human milk .
patient should be advise not to breast feed if they be take aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have be perform .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be caution about operate hazardous machine , include motor vehicle , until they be reasonably certain that aripiprazole do not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the follow undesirable effect occur more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or be identify a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency list below be define use the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient have an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS include parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compare with those treat with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week control trial , the incidence of EPS be 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS be 26.6 % for patient treat with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treat with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient be 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia be 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experience potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter reveal no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , be observe in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compare to 2.0 % of patient who receive placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect know to be associate with antipsychotic therapy and also report during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone be identify in adult patient with report estimate dose up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observe included lethargy , increase blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomit and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have be receive with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom report included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintain an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be consider .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be start immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
follow any confirm or suspect overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
76 activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administer one hour after aripiprazole , decrease aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggest that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there be no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis be unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole be highly bind to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
it have be propose that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be mediate through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibit antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibit high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibit moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos range from 0.5 to 30 mg administer once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produce a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detect by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involve 1,228 schizophrenic patient , present with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole be associate with statistically significantly great improvement in psychotic symptom compare to placebo .
ABILIFY be effective in maintain the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have show an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintain response to medicinal product at 52-weeks be similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate be significantly high for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale use a secondary endpoint , include PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale show a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole have significantly great reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo in
these trial include patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole fail to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrate a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
in a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , who be partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum level , the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy result in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet be bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablet , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet may be use a an alternative to aripiprazole tablet .
absorption :
Aripiprazole be well absorb , with peak plasma concentration occur within 3-5 hour after dose .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation be 87 % .
there be no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole be widely distribute throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicate extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be great than 99 % bound to serum protein , bind primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole be extensively metabolise by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
base on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme be responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation be catalyse by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole be the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represent about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole be approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole be 0.7 ml / min / kg , which be primarily hepatic .
follow a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity be recover in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole be excrete in the urine and approximately 18 % be recover unchanged in the faeces .
78 Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and young adult subject , nor be there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor be there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation have reveal no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoke upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be find to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compare to young healthy subject .
Hepatic Disease :
a single-dose study in subject with vary degree of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A , B , and C ) do not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study include only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis , which be insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for human base on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect be observe only at dos or exposure that be sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicate that these effect be limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the high nontumorigenic exposure in female rat be 7 time the human exposure at the recommend dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the high dose propose , 30 mg per day , be no more than 6 % of the bile concentration find in the monkey in the 39-week study and be well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
base on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole be consider non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole do not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , include dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , be observe in rat at dos result in subtherapeutic exposure ( base on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos result in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommend clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occur at dos similar to those elicit developmental toxicity .

elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patient 65 year of age or old have not be establish .
owe to the great sensitivity of this population , a low start dose should be consider when clinical factor warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
gender : no dosage adjustment be require for female patient a compare to male patient ( see section 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
smoke status : accord to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment be require for smoker ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduce .
when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor be withdraw from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increase ( see section 4.5 ) .
when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increase .
when the CYP3A4 inducer be withdraw from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduce to the recommend dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitor throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour be inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case have be report early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , include treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study find that there be no increase risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compare to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
cardiovascular disorder :
Aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormality ) , cerebrovascular disease , condition which would predispose patient to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medication ) or hypertension , include accelerate or malignant .
Conduction abnormality :
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation be comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
83 Tardive dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or less duration , there be uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be consider .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS be a potentially fatal symptom complex associate with antipsychotic medicinal product .
in clinical trial , rare case of NMS be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
clinical manifestation of NMS be hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , alter mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevate creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also be report .
if a patient develop sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , include ABILIFY , must be discontinue .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associate with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increase mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associate with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treat with aripiprazole be at increase risk of death compare to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient be 3.5 % compare to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death be vary , most of the death appear to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , include fatality , be report in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient report cerebrovascular adverse event compare with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference be not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there be a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treat with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY be not approve for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associate with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , have be report in patient treat with atypical antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there be no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( include diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compare to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treat with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent be not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treat with any antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY , should be observe for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitor regularly for worsen of glucose control .
weight gain : weight gain be commonly see in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic know to cause weight gain , poorly manage life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain have be report post-marketing among patient prescribe ABILIFY .
when see , it be usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
84 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have be associate with antipsychotic drug use , include ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be use cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
intolerance :
the oral solution contains fructose .
patient with rare hereditary problem of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product .
the oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may cause allergic reaction ( possibly delay ) .
the oral solution contains sucrose .
patient with rare hereditary problem of fructose intolerance , glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the oral solution .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterise by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole have the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
give the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be use when aripiprazole be take in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlap undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with medicine know to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be use .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect be deem not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole be metabolise by multiple pathway involve the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment be require for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increase aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax be unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decrease by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increase aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increase by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in high plasma concentration of aripiprazole compare to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when consider concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increase to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
85 When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 be use concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expect .
follow concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole be 68 % and 73 % low , respectively , compare to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) be administer alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration be 69 % and 71 % low , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be double when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occur with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduce to the recommend dose .
when either valproate or lithium be administer concomitantly with aripiprazole , there be no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole have no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole do not show potential for alter CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole be unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediate by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there be no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advise to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raise by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be use in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole be excrete in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it be not know whether aripiprazole be excrete in human milk .
patient should be advise not to breast feed if they be take aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have be perform .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be caution about operate hazardous machine , include motor vehicle , until they be reasonably certain that aripiprazole do not affect them adversely .
4.8 undesirable effect
the follow undesirable effect occur more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or be identify a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) :
the frequency list below be define use the following convention : common ( & gt ; 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( & gt ; 1 / 1 , 000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .
Extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patient have an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS include parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compare with those treat with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patient .
in another long-term 26-week control trial , the incidence of EPS be 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patient .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patient .
in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS be 26.6 % for patient treat with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treat with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient be 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia be 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experience potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter reveal no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , be observe in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compare to 2.0 % of patient who receive placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect know to be associate with antipsychotic therapy and also report during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone be identify in adult patient with report estimate dose up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observe included lethargy , increase blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomit and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have be receive with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom report included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintain an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be consider .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be start immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
follow any confirm or suspect overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
88 activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administer one hour after aripiprazole , decrease aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggest that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there be no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis be unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole be highly bind to plasma protein .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
it have be propose that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be mediate through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibit antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibit high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibit moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos range from 0.5 to 30 mg administer once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produce a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detect by positron emission tomography .
further information on clinical trial :
Schizophrenia :
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involve 1,228 schizophrenic patient , present with positive or negative symptom , aripiprazole be associate with statistically significantly great improvement in psychotic symptom compare to placebo .
ABILIFY be effective in maintain the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have show an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintain response to medicinal product at 52-weeks be similar in both group ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate be significantly high for patient on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale use a secondary endpoint , include PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale show a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole have significantly great reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo in
these trial include patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole fail to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrate a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole be well absorb , with peak plasma concentration occur within 3-5 hour after dose .
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation be 87 % .
there be no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
distribution :
Aripiprazole be widely distribute throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicate extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be great than 99 % bound to serum protein , bind primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole be extensively metabolise by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
base on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme be responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation be catalyse by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole be the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represent about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole be approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole be 0.7 ml / min / kg , which be primarily hepatic .
follow a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity be recover in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole be excrete in the urine and approximately 18 % be recover unchanged in the faeces .
oral solution :
Aripiprazole be well absorb when administer orally a the solution .
at equivalent dos , the peak plasma concentration of aripiprazole ( Cmax ) from the solution be somewhat high but the systemic
in a relative bioavailability study compare the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole a the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablet in healthy subject , the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax value be 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
the single- dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole be linear and dose-proportional .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and young adult subject , nor be there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor be there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation have reveal no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoke upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be find to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compare to young healthy subject .
Hepatic Disease :
a single-dose study in subject with vary degree of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A , B , and C ) do not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study include only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis , which be insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for human base on conventional study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect be observe only at dos or exposure that be sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicate that these effect be limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the high nontumorigenic exposure in female rat be 7 time the human exposure at the recommend dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the high dose propose , 30 mg per day , be no more than 6 % of the bile concentration find in the monkey in the 39-week study and be well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
base on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole be consider non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole do not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , include dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , be
91 observe in rat at dos result in subtherapeutic exposure ( base on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos result in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommend clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occur at dos similar to those elicit developmental toxicity .

if parenteral benzodiazepine therapy be deem necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection , patient should be monitor for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension ( see section 4.5 ) .
patient receive aripiprazole solution for injection should be observe for orthostatic hypotension .
blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitor regularly .
the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection have not be evaluate in patient with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication ( either with prescribed or illicit medicinal product ) .
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient & apos ; s clinical condition may take several day to some week .
patient should be closely monitor throughout this period .
the occurrence of suicidal behaviour be inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case have be report early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , include treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
result of an epidemiological study find that there be no increase risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compare to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or
in clinical trial of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation be comparable to placebo .
a with other antipsychotic , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trial of one year or less duration , there be uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
if sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be consider .
these symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS be a potentially fatal symptom complex associate with antipsychotic medicinal product .
in clinical trial , rare case of NMS be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
clinical manifestation of NMS be hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , alter mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
however , elevate creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also be report .
if a patient develop sign and symptom indicative of NMS , or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal product , include ABILIFY , must be discontinue .
seizure : in clinical trial , uncommon case of seizure be report during treatment with aripiprazole .
therefore , aripiprazole should be use with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associate with seizure .
elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis :
increase mortality : in three placebo-controlled trial ( n = 938 ; mean age :
82.4 year ; range :
56-99 year ) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associate with Alzheimer & apos ; s disease , patient treat with aripiprazole be at increase risk of death compare to placebo .
the rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient be 3.5 % compare to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
although the cause of death be vary , most of the death appear to be either cardiovascular ( E. G. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( E. G. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse event : in the same trial , cerebrovascular adverse event ( E. G. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , include fatality , be report in patient ( mean age :
84 year ; range :
78-88 year ) .
overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patient report cerebrovascular adverse event compare with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patient in these trial .
this difference be not statistically significant .
however , in one of these trial , a fixed-dose trial , there be a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treat with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY be not approve for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some case extreme and associate with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , have be report in patient treat with atypical antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY .
risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes .
in clinical trial with aripiprazole , there be no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event ( include diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compare to placebo .
precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treat with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent be not available to allow direct comparison .
patient treat with any antipsychotic agent , include ABILIFY , should be observe for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia ( such a polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitor regularly for worsen of glucose control .
96 weight gain : weight gain be commonly see in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidity , use of antipsychotic know to cause weight gain , poorly manage life-style , and might lead to severe complication .
weight gain have be report post-marketing among patient prescribe ABILIFY .
when see , it be usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
in clinical trial aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have be associate with antipsychotic drug use , include ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be use cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Hypersensitivity : a with other medication hypersensitivity reaction , characterise by allergic symptom , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole have the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agent .
give the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole , caution should be use when aripiprazole be take in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlap undesirable effect such a sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
if aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with medicine know to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be use .
potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY :
the administration of lorazepam solution for injection have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole solution for injection when administer concomitantly .
however , in a single-dose , intramuscular study of aripiprazole ( dose 15 mg ) in healthy subject , administer simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam ( dose 2 mg ) , the intensity of sedation be great with the combination a compare to that observe with aripiprazole alone .
a gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect be deem not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole be metabolise by multiple pathway involve the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzyme .
thus , no dosage adjustment be require for smoker .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increase aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax be unchanged .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decrease by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , such a fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
in a clinical trial in healthy subject , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increase aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
the AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increase by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in high plasma concentration of aripiprazole compare to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
when consider concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY , potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient .
when concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduce to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose .
other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitor , may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be apply .
97 upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increase to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
when weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( E. g . , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 be use concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expect .
follow concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole be 68 % and 73 % low , respectively , compare to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) be administer alone .
similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration be 69 % and 71 % low , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be double when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occur with carbamazepine .
John & apos ; s Wort ) may be expect to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be apply .
upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducer , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduce to the recommend dose .
when either valproate or lithium be administer concomitantly with aripiprazole , there be no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentration .
potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal product :
the administration of aripiprazole solution for injection have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam solution for injection when administer concomitantly .
however , in a single-dose , intramuscular study of aripiprazole ( dose 15 mg ) in healthy subject , administer simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam ( dose 2 mg ) , the orthostatic hypotension observe be great with the combination a compare to that observe with lorazepam alone .
in clinical study , 10-30 mg / day dos of aripiprazole have no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole do not show potential for alter CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
thus , aripiprazole be unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediate by these enzyme .
when aripiprazole be administer concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there be no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentration .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant woman .
animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
patient should be advise to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raise by animal reproductive study , this medicinal product should not be use in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole be excrete in the milk of treated rat during lactation .
it be not know whether aripiprazole be excrete in human milk .
patient should be advise not to breast feed if they be take aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
no study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have be perform .
however , a with other antipsychotic , patient should be caution about operate hazardous machine , include motor vehicle , until they be reasonably certain that aripiprazole do not affect them adversely .
98 4.8 undesirable effect
the follow undesirable effect occur more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or be identify a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction ( * ) in clinical trial with aripiprazole solution for injection ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency list below be define use the following convention : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , & lt ; 1 / 10 ) and uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , & lt ; 1 / 100 ) .

in another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS be 26.6 % for patient treat with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treat with lithium .
in the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS be 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patient .
in placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient be 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
in schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia be 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
99 comparison between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experience potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter reveal no medically important difference .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , be observe in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patient a compare to 2.0 % of patient who receive placebo .
other finding :
undesirable effect know to be associate with antipsychotic therapy and also report during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patient , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

4.9 overdose
in clinical trial and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone be identify in adult patient with report estimate dose up to 1,260 mg with no fatality .
the potentially medically important sign and symptom observe included lethargy , increase blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomit and diarrhoea .
in addition , report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in child have be receive with no fatality .
the potentially medically serious sign and symptom report included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptom .
management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintain an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptom .
the possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be consider .
therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be start immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmia .
follow any confirm or suspect overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
activate charcoal ( 50 g ) , administer one hour after aripiprazole , decrease aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggest that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
although there be no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis be unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole be highly bind to plasma protein .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotic , ATC code :
N05AX12
it have be propose that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be mediate through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptor .
Aripiprazole exhibit antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibit high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
Aripiprazole also exhibit moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptor .
interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole dos range from 0.5 to 30 mg administer once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produce a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detect by positron emission tomography .
101 Further information on clinical trial :
in two short- term ( 24-hour ) placebo-controlled trial involve 554 schizophrenic patient present with agitation and disturbed behaviour , aripiprazole solution for injection be associate with statistically significant great improvement in agitation / behavioural symptom compare to placebo and be similar to haloperidol .
in one short-term ( 24-hour ) placebo-controlled trial involve 291 patient with bipolar disorder present with agitation and disturbed behaviour , aripiprazole solution for injection be associate with statistically significant great improvement in agitation / behavioural symptom compare to placebo and be similar to the reference arm lorazepam .
the observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS excitement component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint be 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for lorazepam , and 8.7 for aripiprazole .
in subpopulation analysis on patient with mixed episode or on patient with severe agitation , a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population be observe but statistical significance could not be establish due to a reduced sample size .
in three short-term ( 4 to 6 week ) placebo-controlled trial involve 1,228 schizophrenic patient , present with positive or negative symptom , oral aripiprazole be associate with statistically significantly great improvement in psychotic symptom compare to placebo .
ABILIFY be effective in maintain the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have show an initial treatment response .
in a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patient maintain response to medicinal product at 52-weeks be similar in both group ( oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
the overall completion rate be significantly high for patient on oral aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for oral haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
actual score in rating scale use a secondary endpoint , include PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale show a significant improvement over haloperidol .
in a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia , oral aripiprazole have significantly great reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
weight gain : in clinical trial oral aripiprazole have not be show to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder with oral aripiprazole :
in two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 week .
these trial include patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
in one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involve patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole fail to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
in two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic feature , aripiprazole demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
Aripiprazole also demonstrate a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
absorption :
Aripiprazole solution for injection administer intramuscularly a a single-dose to healthy subject be well absorb and have an absolute bioavailability of 100 % .
the aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hour after an intramuscular injection be 90 % great than the AUC after the same dose a a tablet ; systemic exposure be generally similar between the 2 formulation .
in 2 study in healthy subject the median time to the peak plasma concentration be 1 and 3 hour after dose .
distribution :
Aripiprazole be widely distribute throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicate extensive extravascular distribution .
at therapeutic concentration , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be great than 99 % bound to serum protein , bind primarily to albumin .
Metabolism :
Aripiprazole be extensively metabolise by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathway : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
base on in vitro study , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme be responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation be catalyse by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole be the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
at steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represent about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
elimination :
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole be approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
the total body clearance of aripiprazole be 0.7 ml / min / kg , which be primarily hepatic .
follow a single oral dose of & # 91 ; 14C & # 93 ; -labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity be recover in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole be excrete in the urine and approximately 18 % be recover unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
elderly :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and young adult subject , nor be there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
gender :
there be no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor be there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patient .
smoking and Race :
population pharmacokinetic evaluation have reveal no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoke upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
103 renal Disease :
the pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole be find to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compare to young healthy subject .
Hepatic Disease :
a single-dose study in subject with vary degree of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A , B , and C ) do not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study include only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis , which be insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
administration of aripiprazole solution for injection be well tolerate and produce no direct target organ toxicity in rat or monkey after repeat dosing at systemic exposure ( AUC ) that be 15 and 5 time , respectively , human exposure at the maximum recommend human dose of 30 mg intramuscular .
in intravenous reproductive toxicity study , no new safety concern be observe at maternal exposure up to 15 ( rat ) and 29 ( rabbit ) time human exposure at 30 mg .
Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for human base on conventional oral aripiprazole study of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effect be observe only at dos or exposure that be sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicate that these effect be limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
the high nontumorigenic exposure in female rat be 7 time the human exposure at the recommend dose .
however , the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the high dose propose , 30 mg per day , be no more than 6 % of the bile concentration find in the monkey in the 39-week study and be well below ( 6 % ) their limit of in vitro solubility .
base on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity test , aripiprazole be consider non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole do not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity study .
developmental toxicity , include dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effect , be observe in rat at dos result in subtherapeutic exposure ( base on AUC ) and in rabbit at dos result in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommend clinical dose .
maternal toxicity occur at dos similar to those elicit developmental toxicity .

what be Abraxane ?
Abraxane be a powder that be make up into a suspension for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
it contain the active substance paclitaxel ( 5 mg / ml ) .
what be Abraxane use for ?
Abraxane be use to treat metastatic breast cancer in patient whose first treatment for their metastatic disease have stop work and for whom standard treatment include an ‘ anthracycline ’ ( a type of anticancer medicine ) be not suitable . ‘ Metastatic ’ mean that the cancer have spread to other part of the body .
Abraxane be use on it own .
the medicine can only be obtain with a prescription .
how be Abraxane use ?
Abraxane should only be give under the supervision of a specialist cancer doctor in ward that be specialise in give ‘ cytotoxic ’ ( cell-killing ) medicine .
the recommend dose be 260 mg per square metre of body surface area ( calculate use the patient ’ s height and weight ) .
it be give over a period of 30 minute , every three week .
the dose may be reduce or treatment interrupt in patient who have certain side effect affect the blood or the nerve .
Abraxane should not be use in patient who have severe problem with their liver .
the appropriate dos for patient with mild or moderate liver problem or with kidney problem be not know .
how do Abraxane work ?
the active substance in Abraxane , paclitaxel , belong to the group of anticancer medicine know a the ‘ taxanes ’ .
Paclitaxel block the ability of cancer cell to break down their internal ‘ skeleton ’ that allow them to divide and multiply .
with their skeleton still in place , the cell can not divide and they eventually die .
Abraxane also affect non-cancer cell such a blood and nerve cell , which can cause side effect .
Paclitaxel have be available a an anticancer medicine since 1993 .
conventional type of paclitaxel contain substance ( solvent ) that dissolve the paclitaxel , but can cause side effect .
Abraxane do not contain these solvent .

EU © EMEA 2007 reproduction and / or distribution of this document be authorise for non commercial purpose only provide the EMEA be acknowledge body , and therefore it benefit and risk , in comparison with conventional medicine contain paclitaxel .
how have Abraxane be study ?
the effect of Abraxane be first test in experimental model before be study in human .
the company also present data from the publish literature .
the effectiveness of Abraxane have be study in one main study involve 460 woman with metastatic breast cancer , around three-quarters of whom have receive an anthracycline in the past .
around half of the patient in the study have already receive treatment for their cancer after it have become metastatic .
the effect of Abraxane ( give on it own ) be compare with those of a conventional paclitaxel- containing medicine ( give together with other medicine to reduce side effect ) .
the main measure of effectiveness be the number of patient who ‘ respond ’ after at least five week of treatment .
this be define a the patient ’ s main tumour have disappear or have shrink in size by at least 30 % .
what benefit have Abraxane show during the study ?
Abraxane be more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicine .
overall , in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 woman receive Abraxane respond to treatment , compare with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 receive conventional paclitaxel-containing medicine .
when look only at the patient who be receive their first treatment for metastatic breast cancer , there be no difference between the medicine in term of measure of effectiveness such a the time until the disease get bad and survival .
in contrast , in patient who have take other treatment for metastatic breast cancer before , these additional measure show that Abraxane be more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicine .
therefore , the company withdraw it application for the use of Abraxane a first-line treatment during the assessment of the medicine .
what be the risk associate with Abraxane ?
for the full list of all side effect report with Abraxane , see the Package Leaflet .
Abraxane should not be use in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredient .
it should also not be use in patient who be breast feeding or who have low level of neutrophil in the blood before start treatment .
why have Abraxane be approve ?
the Committee for medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) note that Abraxane be more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicine in patient whose first treatment have stop work , and that , unlike other paclitaxel-containing medicine , it do not need other medicine to reduce side effect .
the Committee decide that Abraxane ’ s benefit be great than it risk for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patient who have fail first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline-containing therapy be not indicate .
the Committee recommend that Abraxane be give market authorisation .

Post-marketing experience
Cranial nerve palsy , vocal cord paresis , and rare report of severe hypersensitivity reaction have be report during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane .
in some patient previously expose to capecitabine , report of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have be report a part of the continue surveillance of Abraxane .
because these event have be report voluntarily during clinical practice , true estimate of frequency can not be make and a causal relationship to the event have not be establish .
4.9 overdose
there be no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose .
in the event of an overdose , the patient should be closely monitor .
treatment should be direct at the major anticipated toxicity , which be bone marrow suppression , mucositis and peripheral neuropathy .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Taxanes , ATC Code :
L01CD01
Paclitaxel be an antimicrotubule agent that promote the assembly of microtubule from tubulin dimer and stabilises microtubule by prevent depolymerisation .
this stability result in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that be essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular function .
in addition , paclitaxel induces abnormal array or “ bundle ” of microtubule throughout the cell cycle and multiple aster of microtubule during mitosis .
Abraxane contain human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles .
Albumin be know to mediate endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituent and in vitro study demonstrate that the presence of albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cell .
it be hypothesise that this enhance transendothelial transport be mediate by the gp-60 albumin receptor , and that there be accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC ( secrete protein acidic rich in cysteine ) .
breast carcinoma :
data from 106 patient accrue in two single-arm open-label study and from 454 patient treat in a randomised phase III comparative study be available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer .
this information be present below .
Single-arm open-label study
in one study , Abraxane be administer a a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg / m2 to 43 patient with metastatic breast cancer .
the second trial utilise a dose of 300 mg / m2 a a 30 minute infusion in 63 patient with metastatic breast cancer .
patient be treat without steroid pre- treatment or plan G-CSF support .
cycle be administer at 3 week interval .
the response rate in all patient be 39.5 % ( 95 % CI :
24.9 % - 54.2 % ) and 47.6 %
35.3 % - 60.0 % ) , respectively .
the median time to disease progression be 5.3 month ( 175 mg / m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.6 – 6.2 month ) and 6.1 month ( 300 mg / m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.2 – 9.8 month ) .
Randomised comparative study :
Sixty-four percent of patient have impair performance status ( ECOG 1 or 2 ) at study entry ; 79 % have visceral metastasis ; and 76 % have & gt ; 3 site of metastasis .
fourteen percent of the patient have not receive prior chemotherapy ; 27 % have receive chemotherapy in the adjuvant set only , 40 % in the metastatic setting only , and 19 % in both metastatic and adjuvant setting .
Fifty-nine percent receive study medicinal product a second or great than second-line therapy .
Seventy-seven percent of the patient have be previously expose to anthracyclines .
result for overall response rate and time to disease progression , and progression-free survival and survival for patient receive & gt ; 1st-line therapy , be show below .

Neurotoxictiy to paclitaxel be evaluate through improvement by one grade for patient experience grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after & gt ; 6 course of treatment be not evaluate and remain unknown .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
the pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel follow 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane at dose level of 80 to 375 mg / m2 be determine in clinical study .
the drug exposure ( AUC ) increase linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng . hr / ml follow dose from 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
follow intravenous administration of Abraxane to patient with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , paclitaxel plasma concentration decline in a multiphasic manner .
the mean Cmax of paclitaxel , which occur at the end of the infusion , be 18.7 µg / ml .
the mean total clearance be 15 l / hr / m2 .
the terminal half-life be about 27 hour .
the mean volume of distribution be 632 l / m2 ; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and / or tissue binding of paclitaxel .
in a study in patient with advanced solid tumour , the pharmacokinetic characteristic of paclitaxel follow Abraxane administer intravenously at 260 mg / m2 over 30 minute be compare with those follow 175 mg / m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administer over 3 hour .
the clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane be large ( 43 % ) than that follow a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and it volume of distribution be also high ( 53 % ) .
difference in Cmax and Cmax correct for dose reflect difference in total dose and rate of infusion .
there be no difference in terminal half-lives .
the protein binding of paclitaxel follow Abraxane administration be estimate at about 90 % .
base on the publish literature , in vitro study of bind to human serum protein , use paclitaxel at concentration range from 0.03 to 1.2 µM , indicate that about 87 % of paclitaxel be bind ; the presence of ranitidine , dexamethasone , or diphenhydramine do not affect protein binding of paclitaxel .
base on the publish literature , in vitro study with human liver microsome and tissue slice show that paclitaxel be metabolise primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel ; and to two minor metabolite , 3 ’ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3 ’ -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel .
the formation of these hydroxylated metabolite be catalyse by CYP2C8 , -3A4 , and both -2C8 and -3A4 respectively .
the effect of renal or hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel have not be formally investigate .
Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patient age over 65 year seem comparable to that in patient less than 65 year .
however , little information in patient over 75 year be available a only 3 patient over 75 year of age where include in the pharmacokinetic analysis .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
the carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel have not be study .
however , base on the publish literature , paclitaxel be a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical dos , base upon it pharmacodynamic mechanism of action .
Paclitaxel have be show to be clastogenic in vitro ( chromosome aberration in human lymphocyte ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mouse ) .
10 in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary / hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( CHO / HGPRT ) gene mutation assay .
Paclitaxel at dos below the human therapeutic dose be associate with low fertility and foetal toxicity in rat .
animal study with Abraxane show non-reversible , toxic effect on the male reproductive organ at clinically relevant exposure level .

for full detail , see the Package Leaflet .
how do Abseamed work ?
a hormone call erythropoietin stimulate the production of red blood cell from the bone marrow .
in patient receive chemotherapy or with kidney problem , anaemia can be cause by a lack of erythropoietin , or by the body not respond enough to the erythropoietin it have naturally .
in these case , erythropoietin be use to replace the miss hormone or to increase red blood cell count .
erythropoietin be also use before surgery to increase the number of red blood cell and help minimise the consequence of blood loss .
the active substance in Abseamed , epoetin alfa , be a copy of human erythropoietin and work in exactly the same way a the natural hormone to stimulate red blood cell production .
the epoetin alfa in Abseamed be produce by ‘ recombinant DNA technology ’ : it be make by a cell that have receive a gene ( DNA ) , which make it able to produce epoetin alfa .
how have Abseamed be study ?
Abseamed be study to show that it be comparable with the reference medicine , Eprex / Erypo , in experimental model and in human .
Abseamed , inject into a vein , be compare with the reference medicine in one main study involve 479 patient with anaemia cause by kidney problem .
all of the patient have be take Eprex / Erypo inject into a vein for at least eight week before they be either switch to Abseamed or remain on Eprex / Erypo .
the main measure of effectiveness be the change in the level of haemoglobin between the start of the study and the evaluation period , between week 25 and 29 .
the company also present the result of a study compare the effect of Abseamed inject under the skin with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patient who be receive chemotherapy .
what benefit have Abseamed show during the study ?
Abseamed be as effective a Eprex / Erypo in increase and maintain red blood cell count .
in the study of patient with anaemia cause by kidney problem , patient switch to Abseamed maintain haemoglobin level to the same extent a those continue to take Eprex / Erypo .
on average , the level of the patient take Abseamed increase by 0.147 g / dl from a start value of 11.7 g / dl .
in comparison , those continue to take Eprex / Erypo have an increase of 0.063 g / dl from a start value of 12.0 g / dl .
the study in patient receive chemotherapy show that Abseamed be also as effective a Eprex / Erypo when it be inject under the skin .
what be the risk associate with Abseamed ?
the most common side effect with Abseamed be an increase in blood pressure , which can sometimes lead to symptom of encephalopathy ( brain problem ) such a sudden , stab migraine-like headache and confusion .
Abseamed can also lead to skin rash and flu-like symptom .
for the full list of all side effect report with Abseamed , see the Package Leaflet .
Abseamed should not be use in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredient .
Abseamed be not recommend for injection under the skin in the treatment of kidney problem because further study be need to make sure that this do not cause allergic reaction .
why have Abseamed be approve ?
the Committee for medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) conclude that , in accordance with EU requirement , Abseamed have be show to have a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile to Eprex / Erypo .
therefore , the CHMP ’ s view be that , a for Eprex / Erypo , the benefit outweigh the identified risk .
the Committee recommend that Abseamed be give market authorisation .
which measure be be take to ensure the safe use of Abseamed ?

4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associate with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associate with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompany by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receive chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assess by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be use to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balance against the report risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be use to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , have a high perceive risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
2 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aim for be between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
Abseamed should be administer intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of great than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoid .
if it occur , appropriate dose adjustment should be make a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoid .
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluate prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administer if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be exclude before institute therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose be between 75 and 300 IU / kg give by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
3 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal be achieve .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require high maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos be observe in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg give 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , follow if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal be achieve ( this should be do in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induce anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administer by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose be 150 IU / kg give subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administer at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin have increase by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase be & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin have increase ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin have increase & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy be unlikely and treatment should be discontinue .
the recommended dosing regimen be describe in the following diagram :
5 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / d
and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
12 g / dl )
300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduce by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be give by the intravenous route .
at the time of donate blood , Abseamed should be administer after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) require predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treat with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be start as soon a possible , even several week prior to initiate the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to start Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be use .
6 The recommend dose be 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , give weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there be a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be give daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when perform haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or high , administration of epoetin alfa should be stop and further dos should not be give .
care should be take to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient be not iron deficient .
all patient be treat with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be start prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed be a sterile but unpreserved product and be for single use only .
administer the amount require .
this medicinal product must not be administer by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depend on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be give during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be give at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , follow by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slow injection be preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceed .
in case of large volume , more than one site should be choose for the injection .
the injection be give in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed have not to be administer subcutaneously !
the intravenous route have to be use ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) follow treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increase the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month precede treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increase risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participate in an autologous blood predonation programme be contraindicate in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , include patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receive epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitor and control a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treat
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be control , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinue .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it be recommend that the platelet count be regularly monitor during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be consider and treat prior to initiate therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assure :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) be recommend for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level be below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day be recommend for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation be below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully consider when decide to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be use in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA have be very rarely report after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA be suspect , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinue immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commence because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be give to patient when indicate .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , be not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommend in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increase risk of death and serious cardiovascular event be observe when erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) be administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
control clinical trial have not show significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration be increase beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
8 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia have be observe in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increase appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjust periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitor in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevate ( or rise ) serum potassium level be detect then consideration should be give to cease epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia have be correct .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis be frequently require during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increase packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system be possible if heparinisation be not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommend under section 4.2 .
base on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis do not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
in cancer patient receive chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be take into account when assess if epoetin alfa therapy be appropriate ( patient at risk of be transfuse ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measure on a regular basis until a stable level be achieve and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) have be observe in cancer patient receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increase risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer be design to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extend beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event be higher in patient receive epoetin alfa than in those receive placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be base on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be consider in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient be be treat ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associate with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respect .
9 patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be establish and treat , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from the treatment in this patient group .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be take in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
therefore , it should not be use in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins be growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there be a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not be show to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associate with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have show :
- decrease locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shorten overall survival and increase death attribute to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increase risk of death when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receive neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs be not indicate for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exist that indicate that treatment with epoetin alfa alter the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin be bind by red blood cell there be potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa be give concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitor and the dose of cyclosporin adjust a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exist that indicate an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have show reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be use in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweigh the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participate in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa be not recommend .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed have no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction be an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have be describe in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis have be observe but it occurrence be very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have be report in patient receive erythropoietic agent , include patient receive epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have be rarely report with epoetin alfa include isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) have be report after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have be observe ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa be a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treat with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure be recommend particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occur in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalise tonoclonal seizure , require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complication ( E. G. stenoses , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , be recommend in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treat patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitor .
11 An increase incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) have be observe in patient receive erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease follow repeat phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be perform in such patient .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which be DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appear to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dose group and placebo group , although the clinical experience be limit .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa be very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that be extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be perform if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provide a necessary .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin be a glycoprotein that stimulate , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiate hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin be 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contribute about 58 % and consist of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain be attach via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtain by gene technology be glycosylated and be identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that have be isolate from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed have the high possible purity accord to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line use for the production be detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that be use in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa have be demonstrate in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase as well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increase 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleate spleen cell have be find in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be show with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and do not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detect .
12 721 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receive non-platinum chemotherapy , there be a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decrease energy , and activity reduction ) , a measure by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other small , randomise , placebo-controlled trial fail to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin be a growth factor that primarily stimulate red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have be examine in five large control study involve a total of 2833 patient , of which four be double-blind placebo-controlled study and one be an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who be be treat with chemotherapy ( two study ) or use patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent be not indicate : anaemia in patient with cancer not receive chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study be & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remain three study it be 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there be no difference in overall survival between patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival range between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have show an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associate with various common cancer who receive recombinant human erythropoietin compare to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explain by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those give recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review have also be perform involve more than 9000 cancer patient participate in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produce a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increase relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) be observe in patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there be an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be exclude .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treat with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration less than 13 g / dl , be unclear because few patient with these characteristic be include in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa follow multiple dose intravenous administration reveal a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour have be report in child .
Subcutaneous route
follow subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa be much low than the level achieve follow intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak be always well below the peak achieve use the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there be no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they be determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life be difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and be estimate about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa be much low than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy be associate with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis be a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be relate to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis be not increase in a study of haemodialysis patient who be treat with epoetin alfa for 3 year compare to a match control group of dialysis patient who have not be treat with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa have be show to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when give in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change be interpret a be secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa do not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not be carry out .
there be conflict report in the literature regard whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report be base on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but be of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associate with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associate with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompany by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receive chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assess by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be use to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balance against the report risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be use to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , have a high perceive risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed have to be initiate under the supervision of physician experience in the management of patient with the above indication .
16 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aim for be between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
Abseamed should be administer intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of great than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoid .
if it occur , appropriate dose adjustment should be make a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoid .
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluate prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administer if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be exclude before institute therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose be between 75 and 300 IU / kg give by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
17 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal be achieve .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require high maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos be observe in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg give 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , follow if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal be achieve ( this should be do in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induce anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administer by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose be 150 IU / kg give subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administer at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin have increase by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase be & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin have increase ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin have increase & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy be unlikely and treatment should be discontinue .
the recommended dosing regimen be describe in the following diagram :
19 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / d
and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
12 g / dl )
300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduce by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be give by the intravenous route .
at the time of donate blood , Abseamed should be administer after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) require predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treat with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be start as soon a possible , even several week prior to initiate the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to start Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be use .
20 The recommend dose be 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , give weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there be a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be give daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when perform haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or high , administration of epoetin alfa should be stop and further dos should not be give .
care should be take to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient be not iron deficient .
all patient be treat with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be start prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed be a sterile but unpreserved product and be for single use only .
administer the amount require .
this medicinal product must not be administer by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depend on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be give during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be give at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , follow by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slow injection be preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceed .
in case of large volume , more than one site should be choose for the injection .
the injection be give in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed have not to be administer subcutaneously !
the intravenous route have to be use ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) follow treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increase the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month precede treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increase risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participate in an autologous blood predonation programme be contraindicate in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , include patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receive epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitor and control a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treat
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be control , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinue .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it be recommend that the platelet count be regularly monitor during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be consider and treat prior to initiate therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assure :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) be recommend for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level be below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day be recommend for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation be below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully consider when decide to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be use in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA have be very rarely report after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA be suspect , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinue immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commence because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be give to patient when indicate .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , be not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommend in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increase risk of death and serious cardiovascular event be observe when erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) be administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
control clinical trial have not show significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration be increase beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
22 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia have be observe in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increase appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjust periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitor in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevate ( or rise ) serum potassium level be detect then consideration should be give to cease epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia have be correct .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis be frequently require during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increase packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system be possible if heparinisation be not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommend under section 4.2 .
base on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis do not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
in cancer patient receive chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be take into account when assess if epoetin alfa therapy be appropriate ( patient at risk of be transfuse ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measure on a regular basis until a stable level be achieve and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) have be observe in cancer patient receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increase risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer be design to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extend beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event be higher in patient receive epoetin alfa than in those receive placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be base on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be consider in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient be be treat ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associate with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respect .
23 patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be establish and treat , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from the treatment in this patient group .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be take in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
therefore , it should not be use in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins be growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there be a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not be show to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associate with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have show :
- decrease locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shorten overall survival and increase death attribute to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increase risk of death when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receive neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs be not indicate for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exist that indicate that treatment with epoetin alfa alter the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin be bind by red blood cell there be potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa be give concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitor and the dose of cyclosporin adjust a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exist that indicate an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have show reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be use in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweigh the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participate in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa be not recommend .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed have no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction be an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have be describe in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis have be observe but it occurrence be very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have be report in patient receive erythropoietic agent , include patient receive epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have be rarely report with epoetin alfa include isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) have be report after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have be observe ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa be a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treat with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure be recommend particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occur in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalise tonoclonal seizure , require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complication ( E. G. stenoses , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , be recommend in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treat patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitor .
25 An increase incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) have be observe in patient receive erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease follow repeat phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be perform in such patient .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which be DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appear to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dose group and placebo group , although the clinical experience be limit .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa be very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that be extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be perform if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provide a necessary .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin be a glycoprotein that stimulate , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiate hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin be 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contribute about 58 % and consist of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain be attach via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtain by gene technology be glycosylated and be identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that have be isolate from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed have the high possible purity accord to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line use for the production be detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that be use in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa have be demonstrate in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase as well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increase 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleate spleen cell have be find in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be show with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and do not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detect .
26 721 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receive non-platinum chemotherapy , there be a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decrease energy , and activity reduction ) , a measure by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other small , randomise , placebo-controlled trial fail to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin be a growth factor that primarily stimulate red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have be examine in five large control study involve a total of 2833 patient , of which four be double-blind placebo-controlled study and one be an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who be be treat with chemotherapy ( two study ) or use patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent be not indicate : anaemia in patient with cancer not receive chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study be & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remain three study it be 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there be no difference in overall survival between patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival range between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have show an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associate with various common cancer who receive recombinant human erythropoietin compare to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explain by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those give recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review have also be perform involve more than 9000 cancer patient participate in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produce a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increase relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) be observe in patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there be an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be exclude .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treat with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration less than 13 g / dl , be unclear because few patient with these characteristic be include in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa follow multiple dose intravenous administration reveal a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour have be report in child .
Subcutaneous route
follow subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa be much low than the level achieve follow intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak be always well below the peak achieve use the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there be no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they be determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life be difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and be estimate about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa be much low than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy be associate with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis be a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be relate to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis be not increase in a study of haemodialysis patient who be treat with epoetin alfa for 3 year compare to a match control group of dialysis patient who have not be treat with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa have be show to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when give in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change be interpret a be secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa do not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not be carry out .
there be conflict report in the literature regard whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report be base on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but be of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associate with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associate with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompany by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receive chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assess by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be use to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balance against the report risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be use to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , have a high perceive risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed have to be initiate under the supervision of physician experience in the management of patient with the above indication .
30 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aim for be between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
Abseamed should be administer intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of great than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoid .
if it occur , appropriate dose adjustment should be make a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoid .
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluate prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administer if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be exclude before institute therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose be between 75 and 300 IU / kg give by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
31 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal be achieve .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require high maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos be observe in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg give 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , follow if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal be achieve ( this should be do in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induce anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administer by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose be 150 IU / kg give subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administer at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin have increase by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase be & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin have increase ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin have increase & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy be unlikely and treatment should be discontinue .
the recommended dosing regimen be describe in the following diagram :
33 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl

Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduce by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be give by the intravenous route .
at the time of donate blood , Abseamed should be administer after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) require predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treat with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be start as soon a possible , even several week prior to initiate the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to start Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be use .
34 The recommend dose be 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , give weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there be a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be give daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when perform haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or high , administration of epoetin alfa should be stop and further dos should not be give .
care should be take to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient be not iron deficient .
all patient be treat with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be start prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed be a sterile but unpreserved product and be for single use only .
administer the amount require .
this medicinal product must not be administer by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depend on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be give during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be give at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , follow by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slow injection be preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceed .
in case of large volume , more than one site should be choose for the injection .
the injection be give in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed have not to be administer subcutaneously !
the intravenous route have to be use ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) follow treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increase the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month precede treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increase risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participate in an autologous blood predonation programme be contraindicate in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , include patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receive epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitor and control a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treat
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be control , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinue .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it be recommend that the platelet count be regularly monitor during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be consider and treat prior to initiate therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assure :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) be recommend for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level be below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day be recommend for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation be below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully consider when decide to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be use in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA have be very rarely report after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA be suspect , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinue immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commence because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be give to patient when indicate .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , be not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommend in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increase risk of death and serious cardiovascular event be observe when erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) be administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
control clinical trial have not show significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration be increase beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
36 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia have be observe in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increase appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjust periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitor in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevate ( or rise ) serum potassium level be detect then consideration should be give to cease epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia have be correct .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis be frequently require during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increase packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system be possible if heparinisation be not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommend under section 4.2 .
base on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis do not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
in cancer patient receive chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be take into account when assess if epoetin alfa therapy be appropriate ( patient at risk of be transfuse ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measure on a regular basis until a stable level be achieve and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) have be observe in cancer patient receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increase risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer be design to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extend beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event be higher in patient receive epoetin alfa than in those receive placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be base on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be consider in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient be be treat ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associate with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respect .
37 patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be establish and treat , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from the treatment in this patient group .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be take in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
therefore , it should not be use in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins be growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there be a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not be show to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associate with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have show :
- decrease locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shorten overall survival and increase death attribute to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increase risk of death when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receive neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs be not indicate for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exist that indicate that treatment with epoetin alfa alter the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin be bind by red blood cell there be potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa be give concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitor and the dose of cyclosporin adjust a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exist that indicate an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have show reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be use in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweigh the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participate in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa be not recommend .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed have no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction be an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have be describe in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis have be observe but it occurrence be very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have be report in patient receive erythropoietic agent , include patient receive epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have be rarely report with epoetin alfa include isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) have be report after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have be observe ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa be a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treat with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure be recommend particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occur in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalise tonoclonal seizure , require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complication ( E. G. stenoses , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , be recommend in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treat patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitor .
39 An increase incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) have be observe in patient receive erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease follow repeat phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be perform in such patient .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which be DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appear to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dose group and placebo group , although the clinical experience be limit .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa be very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that be extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be perform if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provide a necessary .

pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin be a glycoprotein that stimulate , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiate hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin be 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contribute about 58 % and consist of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain be attach via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtain by gene technology be glycosylated and be identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that have be isolate from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed have the high possible purity accord to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line use for the production be detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that be use in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa have be demonstrate in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase as well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increase 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleate spleen cell have be find in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be show with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and do not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detect .
40 721 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receive non-platinum chemotherapy , there be a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decrease energy , and activity reduction ) , a measure by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other small , randomise , placebo-controlled trial fail to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin be a growth factor that primarily stimulate red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have be examine in five large control study involve a total of 2833 patient , of which four be double-blind placebo-controlled study and one be an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who be be treat with chemotherapy ( two study ) or use patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent be not indicate : anaemia in patient with cancer not receive chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study be & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remain three study it be 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there be no difference in overall survival between patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival range between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have show an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associate with various common cancer who receive recombinant human erythropoietin compare to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explain by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those give recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review have also be perform involve more than 9000 cancer patient participate in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produce a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increase relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) be observe in patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there be an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be exclude .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treat with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration less than 13 g / dl , be unclear because few patient with these characteristic be include in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa follow multiple dose intravenous administration reveal a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour have be report in child .
Subcutaneous route
follow subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa be much low than the level achieve follow intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak be always well below the peak achieve use the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there be no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they be determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life be difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and be estimate about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa be much low than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy be associate with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis be a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be relate to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis be not increase in a study of haemodialysis patient who be treat with epoetin alfa for 3 year compare to a match control group of dialysis patient who have not be treat with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa have be show to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when give in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change be interpret a be secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa do not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not be carry out .
there be conflict report in the literature regard whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report be base on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but be of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associate with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associate with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompany by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receive chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assess by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be use to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balance against the report risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be use to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , have a high perceive risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed have to be initiate under the supervision of physician experience in the management of patient with the above indication .
44 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aim for be between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
Abseamed should be administer intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of great than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoid .
if it occur , appropriate dose adjustment should be make a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoid .
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluate prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administer if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be exclude before institute therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose be between 75 and 300 IU / kg give by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
45 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal be achieve .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require high maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos be observe in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg give 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , follow if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal be achieve ( this should be do in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induce anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administer by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose be 150 IU / kg give subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administer at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin have increase by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase be & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin have increase ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin have increase & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy be unlikely and treatment should be discontinue .
the recommended dosing regimen be describe in the following diagram :
47 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl

Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduce by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be give by the intravenous route .
at the time of donate blood , Abseamed should be administer after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) require predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treat with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be start as soon a possible , even several week prior to initiate the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to start Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be use .
48 The recommend dose be 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , give weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there be a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be give daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when perform haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or high , administration of epoetin alfa should be stop and further dos should not be give .
care should be take to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient be not iron deficient .
all patient be treat with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be start prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed be a sterile but unpreserved product and be for single use only .
administer the amount require .
this medicinal product must not be administer by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depend on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be give during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be give at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , follow by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slow injection be preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceed .
in case of large volume , more than one site should be choose for the injection .
the injection be give in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed have not to be administer subcutaneously !
the intravenous route have to be use ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) follow treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increase the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month precede treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increase risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participate in an autologous blood predonation programme be contraindicate in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , include patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receive epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitor and control a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treat
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be control , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinue .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it be recommend that the platelet count be regularly monitor during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be consider and treat prior to initiate therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assure :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) be recommend for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level be below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day be recommend for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation be below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully consider when decide to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be use in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA have be very rarely report after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA be suspect , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinue immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commence because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be give to patient when indicate .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , be not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommend in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increase risk of death and serious cardiovascular event be observe when erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) be administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
control clinical trial have not show significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration be increase beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
50 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia have be observe in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increase appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjust periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitor in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevate ( or rise ) serum potassium level be detect then consideration should be give to cease epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia have be correct .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis be frequently require during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increase packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system be possible if heparinisation be not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommend under section 4.2 .
base on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis do not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
in cancer patient receive chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be take into account when assess if epoetin alfa therapy be appropriate ( patient at risk of be transfuse ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measure on a regular basis until a stable level be achieve and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) have be observe in cancer patient receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increase risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer be design to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extend beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event be higher in patient receive epoetin alfa than in those receive placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be base on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be consider in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient be be treat ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associate with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respect .
51 patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be establish and treat , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from the treatment in this patient group .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be take in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
therefore , it should not be use in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins be growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there be a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not be show to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associate with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have show :
- decrease locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shorten overall survival and increase death attribute to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increase risk of death when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receive neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs be not indicate for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exist that indicate that treatment with epoetin alfa alter the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin be bind by red blood cell there be potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa be give concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitor and the dose of cyclosporin adjust a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exist that indicate an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have show reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be use in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweigh the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participate in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa be not recommend .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed have no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction be an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have be describe in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis have be observe but it occurrence be very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have be report in patient receive erythropoietic agent , include patient receive epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have be rarely report with epoetin alfa include isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) have be report after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have be observe ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa be a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treat with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure be recommend particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occur in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalise tonoclonal seizure , require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complication ( E. G. stenoses , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , be recommend in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treat patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitor .
53 An increase incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) have be observe in patient receive erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease follow repeat phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be perform in such patient .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which be DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appear to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dose group and placebo group , although the clinical experience be limit .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa be very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that be extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be perform if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provide a necessary .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin be a glycoprotein that stimulate , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiate hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin be 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contribute about 58 % and consist of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain be attach via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtain by gene technology be glycosylated and be identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that have be isolate from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed have the high possible purity accord to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line use for the production be detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that be use in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa have be demonstrate in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase as well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increase 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleate spleen cell have be find in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be show with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and do not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detect .
54 721 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receive non-platinum chemotherapy , there be a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decrease energy , and activity reduction ) , a measure by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other small , randomise , placebo-controlled trial fail to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin be a growth factor that primarily stimulate red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have be examine in five large control study involve a total of 2833 patient , of which four be double-blind placebo-controlled study and one be an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who be be treat with chemotherapy ( two study ) or use patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent be not indicate : anaemia in patient with cancer not receive chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study be & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remain three study it be 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there be no difference in overall survival between patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival range between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have show an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associate with various common cancer who receive recombinant human erythropoietin compare to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explain by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those give recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review have also be perform involve more than 9000 cancer patient participate in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produce a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increase relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) be observe in patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there be an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be exclude .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treat with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration less than 13 g / dl , be unclear because few patient with these characteristic be include in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa follow multiple dose intravenous administration reveal a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour have be report in child .
Subcutaneous route
follow subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa be much low than the level achieve follow intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak be always well below the peak achieve use the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there be no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they be determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life be difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and be estimate about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa be much low than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy be associate with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis be a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be relate to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis be not increase in a study of haemodialysis patient who be treat with epoetin alfa for 3 year compare to a match control group of dialysis patient who have not be treat with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa have be show to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when give in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change be interpret a be secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa do not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not be carry out .
there be conflict report in the literature regard whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report be base on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but be of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associate with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associate with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompany by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receive chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assess by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be use to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balance against the report risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be use to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , have a high perceive risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed have to be initiate under the supervision of physician experience in the management of patient with the above indication .
58 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aim for be between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
Abseamed should be administer intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of great than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoid .
if it occur , appropriate dose adjustment should be make a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoid .
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluate prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administer if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be exclude before institute therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose be between 75 and 300 IU / kg give by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
59 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal be achieve .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require high maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos be observe in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg give 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , follow if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal be achieve ( this should be do in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induce anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administer by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose be 150 IU / kg give subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administer at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin have increase by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase be & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin have increase ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin have increase & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy be unlikely and treatment should be discontinue .
the recommended dosing regimen be describe in the following diagram :
61 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl

dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduce by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be give by the intravenous route .
at the time of donate blood , Abseamed should be administer after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) require predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treat with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be start as soon a possible , even several week prior to initiate the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to start Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be use .
62 The recommend dose be 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , give weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there be a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be give daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when perform haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or high , administration of epoetin alfa should be stop and further dos should not be give .
care should be take to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient be not iron deficient .
all patient be treat with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be start prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed be a sterile but unpreserved product and be for single use only .
administer the amount require .
this medicinal product must not be administer by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depend on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be give during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be give at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , follow by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slow injection be preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceed .
in case of large volume , more than one site should be choose for the injection .
the injection be give in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed have not to be administer subcutaneously !
the intravenous route have to be use ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) follow treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increase the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month precede treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increase risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participate in an autologous blood predonation programme be contraindicate in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , include patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receive epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitor and control a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treat
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be control , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinue .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it be recommend that the platelet count be regularly monitor during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be consider and treat prior to initiate therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assure :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) be recommend for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level be below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day be recommend for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation be below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully consider when decide to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be use in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA have be very rarely report after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA be suspect , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinue immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commence because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be give to patient when indicate .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , be not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommend in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increase risk of death and serious cardiovascular event be observe when erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) be administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
control clinical trial have not show significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration be increase beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
64 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia have be observe in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increase appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjust periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitor in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevate ( or rise ) serum potassium level be detect then consideration should be give to cease epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia have be correct .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis be frequently require during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increase packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system be possible if heparinisation be not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommend under section 4.2 .
base on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis do not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
in cancer patient receive chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be take into account when assess if epoetin alfa therapy be appropriate ( patient at risk of be transfuse ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measure on a regular basis until a stable level be achieve and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) have be observe in cancer patient receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increase risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer be design to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extend beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event be higher in patient receive epoetin alfa than in those receive placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be base on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be consider in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient be be treat ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associate with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respect .
65 patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be establish and treat , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from the treatment in this patient group .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be take in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
therefore , it should not be use in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins be growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there be a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not be show to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associate with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have show :
- decrease locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shorten overall survival and increase death attribute to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increase risk of death when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receive neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs be not indicate for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exist that indicate that treatment with epoetin alfa alter the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin be bind by red blood cell there be potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa be give concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitor and the dose of cyclosporin adjust a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exist that indicate an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have show reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be use in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweigh the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participate in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa be not recommend .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed have no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction be an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have be describe in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis have be observe but it occurrence be very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have be report in patient receive erythropoietic agent , include patient receive epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have be rarely report with epoetin alfa include isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) have be report after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have be observe ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa be a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treat with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure be recommend particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occur in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalise tonoclonal seizure , require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complication ( E. G. stenoses , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , be recommend in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treat patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitor .
67 An increase incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) have be observe in patient receive erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease follow repeat phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be perform in such patient .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which be DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appear to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dose group and placebo group , although the clinical experience be limit .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa be very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that be extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be perform if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provide a necessary .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin be a glycoprotein that stimulate , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiate hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin be 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contribute about 58 % and consist of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain be attach via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtain by gene technology be glycosylated and be identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that have be isolate from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed have the high possible purity accord to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line use for the production be detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that be use in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa have be demonstrate in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase as well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increase 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleate spleen cell have be find in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be show with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and do not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detect .
68 721 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receive non-platinum chemotherapy , there be a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decrease energy , and activity reduction ) , a measure by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other small , randomise , placebo-controlled trial fail to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin be a growth factor that primarily stimulate red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have be examine in five large control study involve a total of 2833 patient , of which four be double-blind placebo-controlled study and one be an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who be be treat with chemotherapy ( two study ) or use patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent be not indicate : anaemia in patient with cancer not receive chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study be & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remain three study it be 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there be no difference in overall survival between patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival range between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have show an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associate with various common cancer who receive recombinant human erythropoietin compare to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explain by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those give recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review have also be perform involve more than 9000 cancer patient participate in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produce a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increase relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) be observe in patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there be an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be exclude .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treat with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration less than 13 g / dl , be unclear because few patient with these characteristic be include in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa follow multiple dose intravenous administration reveal a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour have be report in child .
Subcutaneous route
follow subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa be much low than the level achieve follow intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak be always well below the peak achieve use the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there be no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they be determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life be difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and be estimate about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa be much low than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy be associate with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis be a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be relate to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis be not increase in a study of haemodialysis patient who be treat with epoetin alfa for 3 year compare to a match control group of dialysis patient who have not be treat with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa have be show to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when give in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change be interpret a be secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa do not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not be carry out .
there be conflict report in the literature regard whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report be base on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but be of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associate with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associate with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompany by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receive chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assess by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be use to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balance against the report risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be use to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , have a high perceive risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed have to be initiate under the supervision of physician experience in the management of patient with the above indication .
72 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aim for be between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
Abseamed should be administer intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of great than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoid .
if it occur , appropriate dose adjustment should be make a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoid .
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluate prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administer if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be exclude before institute therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose be between 75 and 300 IU / kg give by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
73 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal be achieve .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require high maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos be observe in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg give 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , follow if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal be achieve ( this should be do in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induce anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administer by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose be 150 IU / kg give subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administer at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin have increase by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase be & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin have increase ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin have increase & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy be unlikely and treatment should be discontinue .
the recommended dosing regimen be describe in the following diagram :
75 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / d
and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
12 g / dl )
300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduce by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be give by the intravenous route .
at the time of donate blood , Abseamed should be administer after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) require predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treat with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be start as soon a possible , even several week prior to initiate the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to start Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be use .
76 The recommend dose be 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , give weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there be a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be give daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when perform haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or high , administration of epoetin alfa should be stop and further dos should not be give .
care should be take to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient be not iron deficient .
all patient be treat with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be start prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed be a sterile but unpreserved product and be for single use only .
administer the amount require .
this medicinal product must not be administer by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depend on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be give during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be give at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , follow by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slow injection be preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceed .
in case of large volume , more than one site should be choose for the injection .
the injection be give in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed have not to be administer subcutaneously !
the intravenous route have to be use ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) follow treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increase the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month precede treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increase risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participate in an autologous blood predonation programme be contraindicate in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , include patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receive epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitor and control a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treat
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be control , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinue .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it be recommend that the platelet count be regularly monitor during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be consider and treat prior to initiate therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assure :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) be recommend for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level be below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day be recommend for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation be below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully consider when decide to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be use in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA have be very rarely report after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA be suspect , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinue immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commence because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be give to patient when indicate .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , be not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommend in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increase risk of death and serious cardiovascular event be observe when erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) be administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
control clinical trial have not show significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration be increase beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
78 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia have be observe in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increase appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjust periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitor in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevate ( or rise ) serum potassium level be detect then consideration should be give to cease epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia have be correct .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis be frequently require during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increase packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system be possible if heparinisation be not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommend under section 4.2 .
base on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis do not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
in cancer patient receive chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be take into account when assess if epoetin alfa therapy be appropriate ( patient at risk of be transfuse ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measure on a regular basis until a stable level be achieve and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) have be observe in cancer patient receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increase risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer be design to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extend beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event be higher in patient receive epoetin alfa than in those receive placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be base on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be consider in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient be be treat ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associate with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respect .
79 patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be establish and treat , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from the treatment in this patient group .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be take in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
therefore , it should not be use in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins be growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there be a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not be show to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associate with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have show :
- decrease locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shorten overall survival and increase death attribute to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increase risk of death when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receive neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs be not indicate for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exist that indicate that treatment with epoetin alfa alter the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin be bind by red blood cell there be potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa be give concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitor and the dose of cyclosporin adjust a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exist that indicate an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have show reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be use in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweigh the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participate in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa be not recommend .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed have no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction be an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have be describe in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis have be observe but it occurrence be very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have be report in patient receive erythropoietic agent , include patient receive epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have be rarely report with epoetin alfa include isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) have be report after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have be observe ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa be a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treat with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure be recommend particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occur in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalise tonoclonal seizure , require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complication ( E. G. stenoses , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , be recommend in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treat patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitor .
81 An increase incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) have be observe in patient receive erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease follow repeat phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be perform in such patient .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which be DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appear to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dose group and placebo group , although the clinical experience be limit .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa be very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that be extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be perform if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provide a necessary .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin be a glycoprotein that stimulate , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiate hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin be 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contribute about 58 % and consist of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain be attach via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtain by gene technology be glycosylated and be identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that have be isolate from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed have the high possible purity accord to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line use for the production be detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that be use in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa have be demonstrate in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase as well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increase 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleate spleen cell have be find in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be show with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and do not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detect .
82 721 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receive non-platinum chemotherapy , there be a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decrease energy , and activity reduction ) , a measure by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other small , randomise , placebo-controlled trial fail to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin be a growth factor that primarily stimulate red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have be examine in five large control study involve a total of 2833 patient , of which four be double-blind placebo-controlled study and one be an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who be be treat with chemotherapy ( two study ) or use patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent be not indicate : anaemia in patient with cancer not receive chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study be & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remain three study it be 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there be no difference in overall survival between patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival range between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have show an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associate with various common cancer who receive recombinant human erythropoietin compare to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explain by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those give recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review have also be perform involve more than 9000 cancer patient participate in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produce a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increase relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) be observe in patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there be an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be exclude .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treat with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration less than 13 g / dl , be unclear because few patient with these characteristic be include in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa follow multiple dose intravenous administration reveal a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour have be report in child .
Subcutaneous route
follow subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa be much low than the level achieve follow intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak be always well below the peak achieve use the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there be no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they be determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life be difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and be estimate about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa be much low than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy be associate with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis be a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be relate to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis be not increase in a study of haemodialysis patient who be treat with epoetin alfa for 3 year compare to a match control group of dialysis patient who have not be treat with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa have be show to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when give in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change be interpret a be secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa do not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not be carry out .
there be conflict report in the literature regard whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report be base on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but be of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associate with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associate with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompany by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receive chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assess by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be use to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balance against the report risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be use to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , have a high perceive risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed have to be initiate under the supervision of physician experience in the management of patient with the above indication .
86 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aim for be between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
Abseamed should be administer intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of great than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoid .
if it occur , appropriate dose adjustment should be make a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoid .
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluate prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administer if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be exclude before institute therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose be between 75 and 300 IU / kg give by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
87 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal be achieve .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require high maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos be observe in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg give 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , follow if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal be achieve ( this should be do in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induce anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administer by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose be 150 IU / kg give subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administer at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin have increase by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase be & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin have increase ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin have increase & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy be unlikely and treatment should be discontinue .
the recommended dosing regimen be describe in the following diagram :
89 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / d
and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
12 g / dl )
300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduce by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be give by the intravenous route .
at the time of donate blood , Abseamed should be administer after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) require predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treat with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be start as soon a possible , even several week prior to initiate the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to start Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be use .
90 The recommend dose be 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , give weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there be a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be give daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when perform haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or high , administration of epoetin alfa should be stop and further dos should not be give .
care should be take to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient be not iron deficient .
all patient be treat with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be start prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed be a sterile but unpreserved product and be for single use only .
administer the amount require .
this medicinal product must not be administer by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depend on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be give during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be give at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , follow by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slow injection be preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceed .
in case of large volume , more than one site should be choose for the injection .
the injection be give in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed have not to be administer subcutaneously !
the intravenous route have to be use ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) follow treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increase the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month precede treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increase risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participate in an autologous blood predonation programme be contraindicate in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , include patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receive epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitor and control a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treat
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be control , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinue .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it be recommend that the platelet count be regularly monitor during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be consider and treat prior to initiate therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assure :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) be recommend for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level be below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day be recommend for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation be below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully consider when decide to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be use in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA have be very rarely report after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA be suspect , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinue immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commence because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be give to patient when indicate .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , be not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommend in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increase risk of death and serious cardiovascular event be observe when erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) be administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
control clinical trial have not show significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration be increase beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
92 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia have be observe in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increase appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjust periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitor in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevate ( or rise ) serum potassium level be detect then consideration should be give to cease epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia have be correct .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis be frequently require during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increase packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system be possible if heparinisation be not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommend under section 4.2 .
base on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis do not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
in cancer patient receive chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be take into account when assess if epoetin alfa therapy be appropriate ( patient at risk of be transfuse ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measure on a regular basis until a stable level be achieve and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) have be observe in cancer patient receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increase risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer be design to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extend beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event be higher in patient receive epoetin alfa than in those receive placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be base on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be consider in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient be be treat ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associate with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respect .
93 patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be establish and treat , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from the treatment in this patient group .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be take in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
therefore , it should not be use in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins be growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there be a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not be show to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associate with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have show :
- decrease locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shorten overall survival and increase death attribute to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increase risk of death when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receive neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs be not indicate for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exist that indicate that treatment with epoetin alfa alter the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin be bind by red blood cell there be potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa be give concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitor and the dose of cyclosporin adjust a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exist that indicate an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have show reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be use in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweigh the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participate in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa be not recommend .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed have no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction be an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have be describe in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis have be observe but it occurrence be very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have be report in patient receive erythropoietic agent , include patient receive epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have be rarely report with epoetin alfa include isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) have be report after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have be observe ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa be a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treat with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure be recommend particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occur in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalise tonoclonal seizure , require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complication ( E. G. stenoses , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , be recommend in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treat patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitor .
95 An increase incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) have be observe in patient receive erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease follow repeat phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be perform in such patient .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which be DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appear to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dose group and placebo group , although the clinical experience be limit .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa be very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that be extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be perform if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provide a necessary .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin be a glycoprotein that stimulate , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiate hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin be 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contribute about 58 % and consist of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain be attach via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtain by gene technology be glycosylated and be identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that have be isolate from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed have the high possible purity accord to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line use for the production be detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that be use in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa have be demonstrate in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase as well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increase 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleate spleen cell have be find in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be show with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and do not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detect .
96 721 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receive non-platinum chemotherapy , there be a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decrease energy , and activity reduction ) , a measure by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other small , randomise , placebo-controlled trial fail to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin be a growth factor that primarily stimulate red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have be examine in five large control study involve a total of 2833 patient , of which four be double-blind placebo-controlled study and one be an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who be be treat with chemotherapy ( two study ) or use patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent be not indicate : anaemia in patient with cancer not receive chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study be & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remain three study it be 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there be no difference in overall survival between patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival range between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have show an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associate with various common cancer who receive recombinant human erythropoietin compare to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explain by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those give recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review have also be perform involve more than 9000 cancer patient participate in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produce a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increase relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) be observe in patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there be an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be exclude .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treat with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration less than 13 g / dl , be unclear because few patient with these characteristic be include in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa follow multiple dose intravenous administration reveal a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour have be report in child .
Subcutaneous route
follow subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa be much low than the level achieve follow intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak be always well below the peak achieve use the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there be no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they be determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life be difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and be estimate about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa be much low than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy be associate with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis be a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be relate to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis be not increase in a study of haemodialysis patient who be treat with epoetin alfa for 3 year compare to a match control group of dialysis patient who have not be treat with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa have be show to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when give in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change be interpret a be secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa do not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not be carry out .
there be conflict report in the literature regard whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report be base on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but be of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associate with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associate with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompany by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receive chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assess by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be use to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balance against the report risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be use to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , have a high perceive risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed have to be initiate under the supervision of physician experience in the management of patient with the above indication .
100 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aim for be between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
Abseamed should be administer intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of great than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoid .
if it occur , appropriate dose adjustment should be make a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoid .
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluate prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administer if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be exclude before institute therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose be between 75 and 300 IU / kg give by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
101 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal be achieve .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require high maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos be observe in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg give 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , follow if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal be achieve ( this should be do in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induce anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administer by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose be 150 IU / kg give subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administer at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin have increase by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase be & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin have increase ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin have increase & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy be unlikely and treatment should be discontinue .
the recommended dosing regimen be describe in the following diagram :
103 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / d
and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
12 g / dl )
300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduce by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be give by the intravenous route .
at the time of donate blood , Abseamed should be administer after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) require predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treat with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be start as soon a possible , even several week prior to initiate the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to start Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be use .
104 The recommend dose be 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , give weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there be a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be give daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when perform haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or high , administration of epoetin alfa should be stop and further dos should not be give .
care should be take to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient be not iron deficient .
all patient be treat with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be start prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed be a sterile but unpreserved product and be for single use only .
administer the amount require .
this medicinal product must not be administer by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depend on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be give during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be give at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , follow by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slow injection be preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceed .
in case of large volume , more than one site should be choose for the injection .
the injection be give in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed have not to be administer subcutaneously !
the intravenous route have to be use ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) follow treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increase the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month precede treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increase risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participate in an autologous blood predonation programme be contraindicate in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , include patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receive epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitor and control a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treat
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be control , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinue .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it be recommend that the platelet count be regularly monitor during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be consider and treat prior to initiate therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assure :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) be recommend for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level be below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day be recommend for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation be below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully consider when decide to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be use in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA have be very rarely report after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA be suspect , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinue immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commence because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be give to patient when indicate .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , be not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommend in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increase risk of death and serious cardiovascular event be observe when erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) be administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
control clinical trial have not show significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration be increase beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
106 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia have be observe in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increase appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjust periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitor in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevate ( or rise ) serum potassium level be detect then consideration should be give to cease epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia have be correct .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis be frequently require during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increase packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system be possible if heparinisation be not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommend under section 4.2 .
base on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis do not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
in cancer patient receive chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be take into account when assess if epoetin alfa therapy be appropriate ( patient at risk of be transfuse ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measure on a regular basis until a stable level be achieve and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) have be observe in cancer patient receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increase risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer be design to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extend beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event be higher in patient receive epoetin alfa than in those receive placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be base on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be consider in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient be be treat ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associate with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respect .
107 patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be establish and treat , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from the treatment in this patient group .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be take in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
therefore , it should not be use in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins be growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there be a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not be show to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associate with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have show :
- decrease locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shorten overall survival and increase death attribute to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increase risk of death when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receive neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs be not indicate for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exist that indicate that treatment with epoetin alfa alter the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin be bind by red blood cell there be potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa be give concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitor and the dose of cyclosporin adjust a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exist that indicate an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have show reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be use in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweigh the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participate in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa be not recommend .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed have no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction be an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have be describe in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis have be observe but it occurrence be very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have be report in patient receive erythropoietic agent , include patient receive epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have be rarely report with epoetin alfa include isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) have be report after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have be observe ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa be a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treat with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure be recommend particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occur in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalise tonoclonal seizure , require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complication ( E. G. stenoses , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , be recommend in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treat patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitor .
109 An increase incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) have be observe in patient receive erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease follow repeat phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be perform in such patient .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which be DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appear to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dose group and placebo group , although the clinical experience be limit .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa be very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that be extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be perform if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provide a necessary .
5 .

Epoetin alfa obtain by gene technology be glycosylated and be identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that have be isolate from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed have the high possible purity accord to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line use for the production be detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that be use in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa have be demonstrate in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase as well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increase 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleate spleen cell have be find in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be show with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and do not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detect .
110 721 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receive non-platinum chemotherapy , there be a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decrease energy , and activity reduction ) , a measure by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other small , randomise , placebo-controlled trial fail to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin be a growth factor that primarily stimulate red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have be examine in five large control study involve a total of 2833 patient , of which four be double-blind placebo-controlled study and one be an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who be be treat with chemotherapy ( two study ) or use patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent be not indicate : anaemia in patient with cancer not receive chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study be & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remain three study it be 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there be no difference in overall survival between patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival range between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have show an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associate with various common cancer who receive recombinant human erythropoietin compare to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explain by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those give recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review have also be perform involve more than 9000 cancer patient participate in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produce a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increase relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) be observe in patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there be an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be exclude .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treat with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration less than 13 g / dl , be unclear because few patient with these characteristic be include in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa follow multiple dose intravenous administration reveal a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour have be report in child .
Subcutaneous route
follow subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa be much low than the level achieve follow intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak be always well below the peak achieve use the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there be no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they be determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life be difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and be estimate about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa be much low than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy be associate with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis be a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be relate to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis be not increase in a study of haemodialysis patient who be treat with epoetin alfa for 3 year compare to a match control group of dialysis patient who have not be treat with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa have be show to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when give in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change be interpret a be secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa do not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not be carry out .
there be conflict report in the literature regard whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report be base on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but be of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associate with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associate with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompany by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receive chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assess by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be use to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balance against the report risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be use to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , have a high perceive risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed have to be initiate under the supervision of physician experience in the management of patient with the above indication .
114 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aim for be between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
Abseamed should be administer intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of great than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoid .
if it occur , appropriate dose adjustment should be make a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoid .
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluate prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administer if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be exclude before institute therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose be between 75 and 300 IU / kg give by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
115 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal be achieve .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require high maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos be observe in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg give 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , follow if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal be achieve ( this should be do in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induce anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administer by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose be 150 IU / kg give subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administer at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin have increase by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase be & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin have increase ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin have increase & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy be unlikely and treatment should be discontinue .
the recommended dosing regimen be describe in the following diagram :
117 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl

300 IU / kg 3x / week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduce by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be give by the intravenous route .
at the time of donate blood , Abseamed should be administer after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) require predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treat with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be start as soon a possible , even several week prior to initiate the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to start Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be use .
118 The recommend dose be 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , give weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there be a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be give daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when perform haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or high , administration of epoetin alfa should be stop and further dos should not be give .
care should be take to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient be not iron deficient .
all patient be treat with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be start prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed be a sterile but unpreserved product and be for single use only .
administer the amount require .
this medicinal product must not be administer by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depend on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be give during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be give at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , follow by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slow injection be preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceed .
in case of large volume , more than one site should be choose for the injection .
the injection be give in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed have not to be administer subcutaneously !
the intravenous route have to be use ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) follow treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increase the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month precede treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increase risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participate in an autologous blood predonation programme be contraindicate in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , include patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receive epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitor and control a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treat
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be control , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinue .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it be recommend that the platelet count be regularly monitor during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be consider and treat prior to initiate therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assure :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) be recommend for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level be below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day be recommend for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation be below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully consider when decide to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be use in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA have be very rarely report after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA be suspect , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinue immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commence because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be give to patient when indicate .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , be not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommend in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increase risk of death and serious cardiovascular event be observe when erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) be administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
control clinical trial have not show significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration be increase beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
120 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia have be observe in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increase appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjust periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitor in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevate ( or rise ) serum potassium level be detect then consideration should be give to cease epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia have be correct .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis be frequently require during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increase packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system be possible if heparinisation be not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommend under section 4.2 .
base on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis do not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
in cancer patient receive chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be take into account when assess if epoetin alfa therapy be appropriate ( patient at risk of be transfuse ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measure on a regular basis until a stable level be achieve and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) have be observe in cancer patient receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increase risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer be design to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extend beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event be higher in patient receive epoetin alfa than in those receive placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be base on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be consider in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient be be treat ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associate with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respect .
121 patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be establish and treat , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from the treatment in this patient group .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be take in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
therefore , it should not be use in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins be growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there be a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not be show to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associate with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have show :
- decrease locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shorten overall survival and increase death attribute to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increase risk of death when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receive neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs be not indicate for use in this patient population .

no evidence exist that indicate that treatment with epoetin alfa alter the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin be bind by red blood cell there be potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa be give concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitor and the dose of cyclosporin adjust a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exist that indicate an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have show reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be use in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweigh the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participate in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa be not recommend .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed have no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction be an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have be describe in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis have be observe but it occurrence be very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have be report in patient receive erythropoietic agent , include patient receive epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have be rarely report with epoetin alfa include isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) have be report after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have be observe ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa be a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treat with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure be recommend particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occur in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalise tonoclonal seizure , require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complication ( E. G. stenoses , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , be recommend in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treat patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitor .
123 An increase incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) have be observe in patient receive erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease follow repeat phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be perform in such patient .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which be DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appear to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dose group and placebo group , although the clinical experience be limit .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa be very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that be extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be perform if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provide a necessary .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin be a glycoprotein that stimulate , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiate hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin be 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contribute about 58 % and consist of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain be attach via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtain by gene technology be glycosylated and be identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that have be isolate from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed have the high possible purity accord to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line use for the production be detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that be use in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa have be demonstrate in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase as well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increase 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleate spleen cell have be find in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be show with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and do not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detect .
124 721 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receive non-platinum chemotherapy , there be a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decrease energy , and activity reduction ) , a measure by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other small , randomise , placebo-controlled trial fail to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin be a growth factor that primarily stimulate red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have be examine in five large control study involve a total of 2833 patient , of which four be double-blind placebo-controlled study and one be an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who be be treat with chemotherapy ( two study ) or use patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent be not indicate : anaemia in patient with cancer not receive chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study be & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remain three study it be 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there be no difference in overall survival between patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival range between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have show an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associate with various common cancer who receive recombinant human erythropoietin compare to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explain by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those give recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review have also be perform involve more than 9000 cancer patient participate in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produce a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increase relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) be observe in patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there be an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be exclude .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treat with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration less than 13 g / dl , be unclear because few patient with these characteristic be include in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa follow multiple dose intravenous administration reveal a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour have be report in child .
Subcutaneous route
follow subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa be much low than the level achieve follow intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak be always well below the peak achieve use the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there be no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they be determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life be difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and be estimate about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa be much low than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy be associate with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis be a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be relate to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis be not increase in a study of haemodialysis patient who be treat with epoetin alfa for 3 year compare to a match control group of dialysis patient who have not be treat with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa have be show to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when give in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change be interpret a be secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa do not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not be carry out .
there be conflict report in the literature regard whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report be base on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but be of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

clinical particular
4.1 Therapeutic indication
treatment of symptomatic anaemia associate with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patient :
- Treatment of anaemia associate with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompany by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receive chemotherapy for solid tumour , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion a assess by the patient & apos ; s general status ( E. G. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be use to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme .
it use in this indication must be balance against the report risk of thromboembolic event .
Abseamed can be use to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , have a high perceive risk for transfusion complication .
Hb 10 - 13 g / dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
treatment with Abseamed have to be initiate under the supervision of physician experience in the management of patient with the above indication .
128 Posology
treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patient :
in patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
the haemoglobin concentration aim for be between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
Abseamed should be administer intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a rise in haemoglobin of great than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) over a four week period should be avoid .
if it occur , appropriate dose adjustment should be make a provided .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
in paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoid .
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia .
iron status should be evaluate prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administer if necessary .
in addition , other cause of anaemia , such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be exclude before institute therapy with epoetin alfa .
non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cause : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infection ; inflammatory or traumatic episode ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
adult haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of at least four week .
at each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
the recommended total weekly dose be between 75 and 300 IU / kg give by the intravenous route .
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6 g / dl or & lt ; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 8 g / dl or & gt ; 5 mmol / l ) .
paediatric haemodialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
129 correction phase :
50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
when a dose adjustment be necessary , this should be do in step of 25 IU / kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal be achieve .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
generally , child under 30 kg require high maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adult .
the following maintenance dos be observe in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment :
dose ( IU / kg give 3x / week )
weight ( kg ) & lt ; 10 10 - 30 & gt ; 30
Median 100 75 33
usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
the clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin be very low ( & lt ; 6.8 g / dl or & lt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require high maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia be less severe ( Hb & gt ; 6.8 g / dl or & gt ; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
adult peritoneal dialysis patient :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU / kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injection .
adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
the treatment be divide into two stage :
correction phase :
start dose of 50 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route , follow if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increment ( 3 time per week ) until the desired goal be achieve ( this should be do in step of at least four week ) .
maintenance phase :
dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) .
maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route .
the maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 time per week .
treatment of patient with chemotherapy induce anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administer by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia ( E. G. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition be necessary .
due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observe .
Haemoglobin variability should be address through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
a sustained haemoglobin level of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be
patient should be monitor closely to ensure that the low approve dose of Epoetin alfa be use to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
the initial dose be 150 IU / kg give subcutaneously 3 time per week .
alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administer at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .
if haemoglobin have increase by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 time a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
if the haemoglobin increase be & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
if after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week , the haemoglobin have increase ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count have increase ≥ 40,000 cell / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 time per week .
however , if the haemoglobin have increase & lt ; 1 g / dl ( & lt ; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count have increase & lt ; 40,000 cell / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy be unlikely and treatment should be discontinue .
the recommended dosing regimen be describe in the following diagram :
131 150 IU / kg 3x / week or 450 IU / kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl

Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000 / µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g / dl
Reticulocyte count increase & lt ; 40,000 / µl and Hb increase & lt ; 1 g / dl
discontinue therapy
dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
if the haemoglobin be rise by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceed 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) , the dose should be reduce by approximately 25 to 50 % .
if the haemoglobin exceed 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be give by the intravenous route .
at the time of donate blood , Abseamed should be administer after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
mildly anaemic patient ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) require predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treat with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery .
200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
iron supplementation should be start as soon a possible , even several week prior to initiate the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron store prior to start Abseamed therapy .
treatment of adult patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
the subcutaneous route of administration should be use .
132 The recommend dose be 600 IU / kg epoetin alfa , give weekly for three week ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in case where there be a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three week , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be give daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter .
when perform haematologic assessment during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g / dl , or high , administration of epoetin alfa should be stop and further dos should not be give .
care should be take to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient be not iron deficient .
all patient be treat with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( E. G. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
iron supplementation should be start prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron store .
method of administration
Abseamed be a sterile but unpreserved product and be for single use only .
administer the amount require .
this medicinal product must not be administer by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal product .
1 .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minute , depend on the total dose .
in haemodialysed patient , a bolus injection may be give during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
alternatively , the injection can be give at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , follow by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
a slow injection be preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptom .
2 .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceed .
in case of large volume , more than one site should be choose for the injection .
the injection be give in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall .
in chronic renal failure patient Abseamed have not to be administer subcutaneously !
the intravenous route have to be use ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patient ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patient who develop pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) follow treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - pure Red cell Aplasia ) .
uncontrolled hypertension .
in the indication “ increase the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month precede treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increase risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease .
patient who for any reason can not receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
the use of epoetin alfa in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participate in an autologous blood predonation programme be contraindicate in patient with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , include patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
general
in all patient receive epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitor and control a necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treat
it may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
if blood pressure can not be control , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinue .
Epoetin alfa should be use with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
there may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
this regress during the course of continued therapy .
it be recommend that the platelet count be regularly monitor during the first 8 week of therapy .
all other cause of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency ) should be consider and treat prior to initiate therapy with epoetin alfa .
in most case , the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron store should be assure :
- iron supplementation , E. g .
patient ) be recommend for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level be below 100 ng / ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2 + / day be recommend for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation be below 20 % .
all of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully consider when decide to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patient .
good blood management practice should always be use in the perisurgical setting
pure Red cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA have be very rarely report after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
if anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA be suspect , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinue immediately .
no other erythropoietic therapy should be commence because of the risk of cross-reaction .
appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be give to patient when indicate .
chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , I. E. patient with renal anaemia , be not sufficient .
therefore , in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product have to be administer intravenously .
in patient with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommend in section 4.2 .
in clinical trial , an increase risk of death and serious cardiovascular event be observe when erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) be administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
control clinical trial have not show significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration be increase beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl
134 ( 0.62 mmol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia have be observe in isolated case .
correction for anaemia may lead to increase appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
dialysis prescription may have to be adjust periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolyte should be monitor in chronic renal failure patient .
if an elevate ( or rise ) serum potassium level be detect then consideration should be give to cease epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia have be correct .
an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis be frequently require during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increase packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system be possible if heparinisation be not optimum .
in patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommend under section 4.2 .
base on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis do not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
in cancer patient receive chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be take into account when assess if epoetin alfa therapy be appropriate ( patient at risk of be transfuse ) .
Haemoglobin level should be measure on a regular basis until a stable level be achieve and periodically thereafter .
a an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( TVEs ) have be observe in cancer patient receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patient with an increase risk of thrombotic vascular event , such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs ( E. G. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
an investigational study ( best study ) in woman with metastatic breast cancer be design to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extend beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcome .
in that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event be higher in patient receive epoetin alfa than in those receive placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
in view of the above , in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer .
the decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be base on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
factor that should be consider in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient be be treat ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
all special warning and precaution associate with autologous predonation programme , especially routine volume replacement , should be respect .
135 patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be establish and treat , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weigh against the benefit to be derive from the treatment in this patient group .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , special precaution should be take in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
therefore , it should not be use in patient with baseline haemoglobin & gt ; 13 g / dl .
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins be growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
a with all growth factor , there be a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumour .
in several controlled study , epoetins have not be show to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associate with cancer .
in controlled clinical study , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) have show :
- decrease locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of great than 14 g / dl ( 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- shorten overall survival and increase death attribute to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 – 8.7 mmol / l ) ,
- increase risk of death when administer to target a haemoglobin of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) in
patient with active malignant disease receive neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs be not indicate for use in this patient population .
Excipients
this medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , I. E. essentially “ sodium- free ” .
4.5 interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
no evidence exist that indicate that treatment with epoetin alfa alter the metabolism of other medicinal product .
however , since cyclosporin be bind by red blood cell there be potential for an interaction .
if epoetin alfa be give concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood level of cyclosporin should be monitor and the dose of cyclosporin adjust a the haematocrit rise .
no evidence exist that indicate an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro .
4.6 pregnancy and lactation
there be no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant woman .
study in animal have show reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
consequently :
- In chronic renal failure patient , epoetin alfa should be use in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweigh the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participate in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa be not recommend .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed have no influence on the ability to drive and use machine .
4.8 undesirable effect
the most frequent adverse reaction be an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur .
attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal .
general
non-specific skin rash have be describe in association with epoetin alfa .
& quot ; Flu-like & quot ; symptom such a headache , joint pain , feeling of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis have be observe but it occurrence be very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic / vascular event , such a myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have be report in patient receive erythropoietic agent , include patient receive epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reaction have be rarely report with epoetin alfa include isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) have be report after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa .
in most of these patient , antibody to erythropoietin have be observe ( see section 4.3 and 4.4 – pure Red cell Aplasia )
adult and paediatric haemodialysis patient , adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
the most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa be a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of exist hypertension .
these increase in blood pressure can be treat with medicinal product .
moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure be recommend particularly at the start of therapy .
the following reaction have also occur in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom ( E. G. headache and confused state ) and generalise tonoclonal seizure , require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
particular attention should be pay to sudden stab migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complication ( E. G. stenoses , aneurysm , etc . ) .
early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , be recommend in these patient .
adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receive chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treat patient .
consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitor .
137 An increase incidence of thrombotic vascular event ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) have be observe in patient receive erythropoietic agent .
surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease follow repeat phlebotomy .
therefore , routine volume replacement should be perform in such patient .
patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery
in patient schedule for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular event ( most of which be DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trial , appear to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dose group and placebo group , although the clinical experience be limit .
moreover , in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of & gt ; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associate with an increase risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular event can not be exclude .
4.9 overdose
the therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa be very wide .
overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that be extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be perform if excessively high haemoglobin level occur .
additional supportive care should be provide a necessary .
5 .
pharmacological property
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
B03XA01
erythropoietin be a glycoprotein that stimulate , a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiate hormone , the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment .
the apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin be 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
the protein fraction of the molecule contribute about 58 % and consist of 165 amino acid .
the four carbohydrate chain be attach via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtain by gene technology be glycosylated and be identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that have be isolate from the urine of anaemic patient .
Abseamed have the high possible purity accord to the present state of the art .
in particular , no residue of the cell line use for the production be detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that be use in human .
the biological efficacy of epoetin alfa have be demonstrate in various animal model in vivo ( normal and anaemic rat , polycythaemic mouse ) .
after administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocyte , the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase as well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
an increase 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleate spleen cell have be find in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
it could be show with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and do not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detect .
138 721 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include in three placebo-controlled study , 389 patient with haematological malignancy ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin & apos ; s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancy ) and 332 with solid tumour ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour type ) .
in two large , open-label study , 2697 cancer patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy be include , 1895 with solid tumour ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour type ) and 802 with haematological malignancy .
in a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conduct in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receive non-platinum chemotherapy , there be a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela ( E. G. fatigue , decrease energy , and activity reduction ) , a measure by the following instrument and scale :
functional assessment of cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and cancer linear analogue scale ( CLAS ) .
two other small , randomise , placebo-controlled trial fail to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
erythropoietin be a growth factor that primarily stimulate red cell production .
erythropoietin receptor may be express on the surface of a variety of tumour cell .
survival and tumour progression have be examine in five large control study involve a total of 2833 patient , of which four be double-blind placebo-controlled study and one be an open- label study .
the study either recruited patient who be be treat with chemotherapy ( two study ) or use patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent be not indicate : anaemia in patient with cancer not receive chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patient receive radiotherapy .
the target haemoglobin concentration in two study be & gt ; 13 g / dl ; in the remain three study it be 12 - 14 g / dl .
in the open-label study there be no difference in overall survival between patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and control .
in the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival range between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of control .
these study have show an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associate with various common cancer who receive recombinant human erythropoietin compare to control .
overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explain by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those give recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
a systematic review have also be perform involve more than 9000 cancer patient participate in 57 clinical trial .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produce a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trial and 8167 patient ) .
an increase relative risk of thromboembolic event ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trial and 6769 patient ) be observe in patient treat with recombinant human erythropoietin .
there be an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treat with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be exclude .
the extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer , treat with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration less than 13 g / dl , be unclear because few patient with these characteristic be include in the data reviewed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
measurement of epoetin alfa follow multiple dose intravenous administration reveal a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patient , approximately 5 hour .
a half-life of approximately 6 hour have be report in child .
Subcutaneous route
follow subcutaneous injection , serum level of epoetin alfa be much low than the level achieve follow intravenous injection , the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
the peak be always well below the peak achieve use the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
there be no accumulation : the level remain the same , whether they be determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection .
the half-life be difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and be estimate about 24 hour .
the bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa be much low than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rat , but not in monkey , epoetin alfa therapy be associate with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis be a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be relate to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factor .
the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis be not increase in a study of haemodialysis patient who be treat with epoetin alfa for 3 year compare to a match control group of dialysis patient who have not be treat with epoetin alfa . ) .
in animal study , epoetin alfa have be show to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when give in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose .
these change be interpret a be secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa do not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mouse .
long-term carcinogenicity study have not be carry out .
there be conflict report in the literature regard whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators .
these report be base on in vitro finding from human tumour sample , but be of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .
