without make a parallel between the Soviet Union and present-day Russia , I want to say that what I hear from Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mrs Malmström be gratify because it continue this policy of pragmatic partnership with Russia , highlight that there be issue where the European Union can not achieve success without the involvement of Russia .
it be , of course , too early to comment on this recent round of talk , but we hope that both side will proceed in a constructive manner .
this will have the effect of undermine the principle of equality , universality and social cohesion and , most importantly , the possibility of uphold fundamental human right in practice .

Iran , for it part , must suspend any activity design to obtain nuclear material for military purpose ; it must do so because it have sign the non-proliferation Treaty , thus also undertake to apply it Additional Protocol .

the fact be , however , that until the institutional issue be resolve , this doubt be always present and , particularly when we be outside Europe , we be confront with question to which we have to attach due prominence .
it be important to insist that the Commission draw up a proposal for a common list of additive by the end of 2004 at the late .

we also have an EU that be buy building around Europe in the belief that it be cheap .
what incentive for reform be leave , after all , when the pressure be take off , if it be guarantee that accession be go to go ahead anyway ?
the EU , for it part , have suggest a 25 % reduction in the number of people live in poverty by 2020 and an allocation of 0.7 % of gross national income to development aid .

( HU ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , a my fellow Member , Mr Marinescu , have already point out , the volcanic ash crisis demonstrate that Europe be neither strategically nor technologically prepared for this situation .
can they do it ?
I be very positive that we be on the right route and I believe that what Parliament have put forward have help to strengthen the methodology , also scrutinise the approach which will be involve in this particular battle .
I think that , overall , despite certain attempt in the area of competition , the basic rule have not change .
it would do Russia credit to put this on the agenda , so that these human problem can be solve .
while road haulage company will now have to pay the cost of air and noise pollution generate by lorry , Member States will , in return , be oblige to reinvest the revenue obtain from these charge in pan-European transport network and , especially , in more effective and less polluting transport system .
it be destine to be incorporate in to the Treaties and the Commission think this should be fully realise a part of the reorganisation of the treaty we propose at the Intergovernmental Conference , which we hope the European Council will be able to approve in Nice .
speaking of the implementation period for the Regulation , it be project to be unjustifiably long .
two declaration be attach to that amendment :
no other country have ever dare so coarsely and provocatively to ridicule it own promise , disregard it commitment , make fool of government on both side of the Atlantic in so short a time , show such shamelessness in violate human right inside and outside it own domain , and use even dark method - include murder - to promote it own shady interest .
at present there be a conflict between the Board of the shipyard and the European Commission , which be demand a drastic reduction in the shipyard & apos ; s capacity and the closure of two slipway , or else the refund of state aid .
this should bring u one step closer to a more sustainable transport system .

where there be no forest , then we can grow willow and miscanthus to make sure that we can produce energy supply .
we be tell that the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaties , which would render it bind at European level , would not give the Union any additional competence .
when we discuss and even criticise the effort of the United States to eradicate tyranny and support democracy in Iraq and elsewhere , we must not ignore the game of Russia and China in the region , which may easily end up transform the region into a burn crater of global terrorist war .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I would like to welcome you here to the European Parliament .
( it ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , woman have always have an important role in the agricultural and rural sector .
however , it eventually decide that the revise text do not involve harmonisation procedure , which be cover by Article 100A . a a result , the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens & apos ; Rights agree entirely that Article 235 provide an appropriate legal base .
incidentally , this week , we be also propose a new European mechanism for financial stability .
also , the peace settlement do not apply to west Darfur , since Arab nomad and solder have drive out most of the black population to neighbour Chad .
I take up your invitation Mr President and I should look forward to the visit very much .
let me address the two issue on our agenda today one after the other .
we must therefore concentrate on a thorough analysis and examination of current trend , focus on use new rule to restrict those technology and those possibility which violate the privacy of family and the privacy of child , and which damage the healthy development of the family , and we must apply these rule consistently .
however , have say that , our group will not be able to support this report in tomorrow & apos ; s vote , partly indeed because of this presumption that trade in service be essentially exactly the same a trade in good .
all in all , it be the Commission & apos ; s intention to transfer more responsibility to the Member States in the custom field .
the Commission understand the concern that have motivate the request for a split vote , but feel that the current text address these concern sufficiently .
now , five year later , we see that the new Commission have choose to ignore all of these finding that be so important to our survival .
it be difficult to explain to the European public why , for example , the Prince of Monaco or large multinationals such a Heineken and Nestlé receive hundred of thousand of euro in income support in the form of agricultural subsidy merely because they own some land , whilst real farmer often struggle to make ends meet .
these election be about encourage politician to follow the instruction and recommendation of the military , the & apos ; new & apos ; ally of imperialism in the region .
be there any comment ?
I be delighted that all but one of my amendment be accept in committee , but I would like to point out that the text in recital K be not quite correct .
this proposal confine itself to merely codify the exist text , without any change in their substance .
the vision that the Commission have just outline , of a more socially orientate Europe in the 21st century , be conceptually flawless but bereft of any actual legislative initiative .
opposition to this Treaty be mainly from the far right and some on the extreme left of this House .
a re-evaluation of the additive should therefore be carry out every ten year , take account of new scientific information and research data .
we need concrete progress in important area , of which I will cite just a few .
yet these people can not be reach in the tried and true manner , directly through the traditional network of commercial bank , because these target group be suspicious of the above instrument , and a already mention , they be not able to enter the free market .
( I be proud to have be grant the opportunity to serve the people of Connaught-Ulster , Ireland .
in this connection , however , we have to view new benefit for Members with some reservation .
we have also renew our support for a free Internet by condemn Internet censorship and the threat that it pose to human right , as well a to access to and share of global cultural heritage .
my report deal with this regulation and , a have be say , it concern a key mechanism in the implementation of the European Union & apos ; s goal of free movement of people in that it coordinate social security system .
it be time that our Parliament blow the whistle to bring an end to this little game .
we know they be true from our experience .
I can therefore only warn the Commission not to take these step .
the gunman tie him and his wife to a chair and , a she plead for their life , the Brigade member tell her : & apos ; his time have come & apos ; .
however , a many speaker have say , despite what the Council may say about the importance of education and despite the Commission & apos ; s good faith regard lifelong learning , there be a lack of commitment on financial resource .
the goal have be set of reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10 % and enable 40 % of young people to complete high education by 2020 .
after rice , wheat and maize , banana be the world & apos ; s fourth most important food crop .
what specious reason we be hear from the well-meaning , open-minded Left , however !
Mr President , on behalf of my group I should like to congratulate Mrs RothBehrendt .
although the Dutch policy of tolerance be at least pragmatic , this proposal by the Council be also completely absurd in practice , since it be impossible to govern with amount write in stone .
far from be innocent , this report be dangerous for the freedom and right of the people .
in this context , however , we must not overlook the various initiative to pave the way for so-called giga- or megaliners , which be associate with high infrastructure cost .
with EUR 425 million less ?
in order to restore the citizen & apos ; confidence in Europe , we must make the institution of this Convention more transparent , more efficient and more democratic .
in fact , it complicate the Transatlantic Alliance , produce no additional troop and have no real purpose , except to shift defence and security decision-making responsibility away from NATO headquarters - where European country sit around the same table a our American ally - to the European Union , from which Americans be specifically exclude .
it do not have a legal basis because the Commission should have present to Parliament an evaluation of the measure finance by the Community under this line a far back a October 2000 and propose a new regulation .
the first concern the European Investment Bank .
we must support this compromise which be accept by 72 % of the committee .
we do not witness such barbarity even in the dark Middle Ages .
a we have just see in the debate on Ireland , certain country must not be allow to set low tax rate in order to attract business and then , when they get into financial difficulty , to call on other country to finance their budget deficit , if I can put this in such a simplistic way .
I therefore have another question to put to both the Commission and the Council .
in the area of funding , the report encourage the use of Structural Funds in support of energy efficiency , and call for this to be make a priority within the EU budget after 2013 .
these proposal be downright unfair , to say the very least .
this be not about organise party accord to a single , standardised structure , but about follow a more general model .
it acceptance by the majority of the House will depend on the adoption of important amendment .
secondly , I would like to mention that our committee wish to maintain all it amendment at this stage , especially those relate to Eurostat .
we see from the supplementary and amend budget that the agreement we reach with the Commission be simply not be apply .
but the bearing of arm be also subject to restriction , and these restriction be exceed in the US plan , which have now be leak , concern the use of nuclear weapon .
our proposal will also make the law enforcement process more manageable by facilitate access to information .
Mr President , I do not think that any of u here be contest whether or not there should be an ivory trade : of course there should not .
I shall end with a particularly important issue raise , that of consumer information .
should we not be set the cost of dispose of animal by-product against what it will cost European farmer if there be a renewed outbreak of BSE in their herd or - bad still - if people start fall ill ?
my second point be that Europe must finally provide itself with the instrument necessary to retain or recover production capacity , for example industrial or agricultural production capacity , and to retain - and this be absolutely vital for it future - it technological progress .
the PPE-DE Group be put forward it own resolution and be not able to support the resolution by the other political group , which emphasise widen the campaign to include anti-tank mine and other category of munition .
the euro , of course , limit the potential for & apos ; stray & apos ; capital to speculate on exchange rate .
in modify the exist common consular instruction , it provide firstly for the obligation to supply biometrics which will be store in the vi and the standard for do so , but secondly it include provision on the organisation of receive visa application .
let there be no mistake about it .
I would like to welcome the host of issue raise by this report , which have enable u , regardless of the committee we be work in , to find a series of correlation which need to be achieve so that we make a great contribution to achieve the EU 2020 target .
on the contrary , I believe that , in many area , we have succeed in make progress and finding compromise that be acceptable to everyone .
we do not wish to see agricultural policy return to national control , or appropriation for the Structural Funds remain unaltered , with the same amount of money be distribute between a great number of country .
in another important aspect of our north-south cooperation , however , we must try to encourage the cultivation of alternative crop to get off the ground .
such success be not self-evident .
with regard to the impact of Basel III on both major and small bank , generally speak , we will proceed very carefully with macro- and micro-economic impact study , without improvising , and I will use all flexibility margin in order to develop good measure and good decision that be as well-gauged a possible .
indeed , we need a strong impetus , expertise and a decision timetable which the European Central Bank could draw up and which the Council of Ministers for the euro area , preside by your good self , Mr Juncker , could then adopt and implement .
( BG ) Thank you , Mr President .
furthermore , around 900 million people be chronically hungry due to extreme poverty , while up to 2 billion people lack genuine , long-term food security due to vary degree of poverty .
in turn , defence be constantly change it boundary in a world in which the perception of these be ever more blurred : nowadays , we can not only consider the territorial defence of one State face with a possible attack by another , but rather , a have be correctly say , we have army that lack clear enemy and enemy that lack army .
in the calendar propose , there be a reference to the date of the election in 2009 .
I have my own thought for you also .
the Commission appreciate that citizen and worker need to feel secure in this difficult time .
it would be wrong to oppose the directive because it do not give sufficient right of information and consultation .
that be why I vote for the report on the European Joint undertaking for ITER and the Development of fusion Energy .
for example , one achievement be that all of the excessive deficit in the euro area have be correct .
I would therefore like to ask the European Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of money spend on the fight against HIV / AIDS .
( heckle )
the main legal problem arises when the public authority continue to deny all the other company the opportunity to provide those service in the same area , in a situation of transparent and honest competition .

whereas a few year ago it be predict that by 1998 there would be three million user in Europe , when 1998 come we realise that there be already 18 million , and this growth be still continue .
by vote through this amendment now a part of Amendment No 188 , Parliament would make clear that such Member States could not expect the benefit of host such new agency if they be not prepared to exercise their responsibility .
it should be point out that the Commission have accept such withdrawal in the past and have consequently terminate investigation without take measure .
someone say that the guilty party should be condemn ; well , you will be din with one of them tonight - with President Putin himself .
Chancellor Gordon Brown be ask how much funding be to be allocate to the military action and his answer be & apos ; as much a it take & apos ; .
the future we desire will come about through fundamental technological development , as well a through action that we can all carry out , start today .
well , I believe a reference to the found value of Europe , an explicit reference to Christian value , would be a contribution to our history .
the factual evidence on PR suggest that , bear in mind the spoilt ballot paper that remain in each Member State that have PR , large number of voter reject it at every election .
( RO ) Given that energy efficiency be one of the priority area for the EU & apos ; s economic recovery and for combat climate change , I feel that it be necessary to set up a European fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy to raise the public and private fund for implement specific project across the European Union . this would provide a model of efficiency for use European public money .
it be therefore important to take advantage of the possibility for peaceful and constructive exchange of view a part of a process of dialogue within ACP region and country involve government and civil society .
we must therefore spread this kind of awareness-raising initiative in order to combat discriminatory attitude and to ensure that the citizen be keep informed about their right and obligation .
there be only a few of u leave now , this be the third reading .
I have return from Porto Alegre , and I can tell you that the Brazilians and Argentinians whom I meet there admit that they have be do the same thing in various place , namely feed animal carcass to cattle .
the initial amendment be apparently mistranslate into German to mean exactly the opposite of what the English say because the English text be ambiguous .
I would like to ask the representative of the Council what you think of paragraph 15 and 16 of the report by Mr Tsatsos and Mr Méndez de Vigo . and I would like to ask the representative of the Council to repeat what your Prime Minister , Mr Juncker , say .
the purpose of the treaty change be very specific .
this mean our Parliament run the risk of be dominate , not by the PPE-DE Group or by the Socialist Group , but by AKP Islamists .

it go without say that Arafat be the one who risk the most and the responsibility of a definitive collapse of this peace process would inevitably end up benefit those who believe in religious extremism , fundamentalism ; it would thus sweep aside those who have work for peace , begin with Arafat himself .
